The choke hold Apple has in the psyche of the American consumer is getting pretty weird considering they haven't done anything innovative in the last 7 years. \n\nSo by merging the designs, it may allow users to \"blend in\" while still be in the Samsung ecosystem.\n\nI'd much rather have unique designs, though.",

It's also easier to view more content on screen, but the drawback is it looks less like a watch. That's what an Ultra smart watch should go for. It's not really a device for telling time anymore, it's a device for showing you metrics, sensors and information. I would've been okay with a square display on the Ultra and a circle on the Classic. \n\nThis feels a lot like convergent evolution. \n\nExcept they decided it needed a circle screen and the same size battery as the 5 Pro. So now we get the worst of both - a circle screen so we can't see more content, and a larger body without the larger battery.",

Any company doing the same after that wouldn't face nearly as much backlash as the precedent has been set.\n\nGoogles' almost as bad, try using an Android phone in real life without access to Google services. So many apps require those services, and some are indispensable for example delivery apps that require choosing a point on a map (not all do).\n\nEdit: Back to business, by NOT copying Apple with accessories they would lose market share to the little guys who \\*will\\* sell a look-a-like product.

Ten years ago, when a new phone was released, it would actually be a new phone with an all-new design and new features. Nowadays, we just get next-gen refreshes with the same old designs and slightly faster/more efficient processors, and if we’re lucky, a smaller notch or camera cutout, along with some software gimmicks to make it look better. The next generation Xbox is essentially an Xbox One from 2013 with more powerful and faster hardware. It even uses some of the same components as the last-gen Xbox, which was previously unthinkable for a next-gen Xbox or PlayStation console. The most sold TVs and the most produced media to this day are still 4K, just like in 2017, and there have been no new groundbreaking screen technologies invented. Instead, manufacturers have resorted to stacking OLEDs on top of each other to achieve more brightness because OLED technology itself isn’t being innovated anymore. The new Samsung earbuds are just blatant copies of Apple’s AirPods, which have been around since 2016. Artificial intelligence can be summed up as a software gimmick used by manufacturers to sell more of their most overpriced devices, especially since a lot of it is server-sided. The new iPad Pro is more powerful than any iPad Apple has ever made, yet a 10-year-old MacBook has more functionality. Apple’s latest Apple Silicon MacBooks still start with just 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, the same as 10 years ago. To say that consumer electronics haven’t peaked years ago is just blatantly wrong.\n \nEdit: My point is that with other new generations of consumer electronics, it used to implement revolutionary new hardware and features; it used to actually try to innovate. But nowadays, it’s just evolutionary hardware refreshes. We’ve already hit the peak of what these electronics can do and are now just evolving them to be more powerful and more efficient. The tech has already peaked. There will likely never be an iPhone as revolutionary as the iPhone X again. And every Xbox released from now on will have the same operating system as the Xbox One from 2013. This may seem perfectly normal to you now, but it used to be absolutely unthinkable for different Xbox console generations to share similar hardware or even the same operating system.",

It has all the features and settings that I like. Headphone jack, USB C, expandable storage, a camera with really good photos between 0.5 and 2.0 zoom and still good quality up to 4 or 5 depending on lighting, great battery life. \n\nI think the only reason besides the phone just breaking that I may need to replace it is OS and android updates unfortunately.

Most people have cloud storage now with Google, OneDrive, Box or Dropbox. Photos and larger files are stored there for easy access anywhere. You can even store your music in the cliud and stream your music using apps like CloudPlayer.\nAs for the charger; many people, including many power users, never use the charger that comes in the box. They just use chargers they already have (corded or wireless) or buy additional wireless chargers with their phone purchase anyways.\nSo really...it's not that big of a deal to me.....actually...not a deal at all to me.\nI have plenty of charging devices and 1052GB of cloud storage. I have 150GB of music there and stream it with CloudPlayer, all of my photos/screenshots/videos are all there as well. I have the 256GB Note 10+ and I currently use only 84GB of that.

They did jump ahead on edge to edge with the folded oled screens before falling behind again, so there was at least that. They’re also currently doing weird things with wireless charging. \n\nSamsung loves to show that they have a feature first, such as early OLED as an advertising point. Apple would say that they waited until the tech was “usable”, such as OLED capable of Dolby Vision with no burn in at extreme brightness. \n\nIt depends on if you’re excited to show off a new feature on your phone, or you want it to work for more than five years.",

Apple likes to meter out new features so there's a reason to upgrade every year. Apple was late with 3G, late with 4G LTE, late with 5G, late with NFC, late with bezel-less displays, late with fast charging, late with wireless charging, and still has no under-screen fingerprint readers, no 120Hz displays, no styluses, no reverse charging, no MST, etc.. They are also going to be very late with an SOC that integrates a 5G modem, like the Snapdragon 888 unless they've licensed the 5G modem cell from Qualcomm. \n\nApple is what's known as a \"fast follower\" they are always behind the competition, but not necessarily because they're unable, technologically, to add the same features. Unlike Android, Apple doesn't have to worry about their customers moving to another manufacturer of phones with the same operating system, and the number of users moving in either direction between iOS and Android is very low. Personally I stick with Android because there are several applications not available for iOS, either because Apple won't allow them on their App Store or because iOS can't support those apps due to restrictions in the operating system in terms of what is made available to app developers.",

Sure it's a bit of a pain to order another charger separately but also I think there are plenty of people that wouldn't need another charger and everybody can agree that e waste is a serious issue that does need to be addressed I know everyone goes to the \"big company trying to squeeze as much profit as possible\" and I agree I'm sure that's part of their motives but also I think that if we can make even a small difference in the e waste global issue that would be great",

I get that this is a talking point about how “the word Samsung is on the company that makes Apple’s displays so they should be embarrassed.”\n\nThe issue is that Apple still gave them the designs to use. It was a proven custom order, not purchased off a rack, as they have a different design and spec from the galaxy line. Samsung just happened to be the name on the building that put the machines together that produced the custom order. \n\nIt’s the same way Apple designed the A14/M1 and had TSMC produce it for them.

        "body": "Multiple things to mention here.\n\nFirst. Yes, they still produce chargers, but there's two aspects of business in play here. Number one is cutting cost to increase profit. They produce phones for a manufacturing price that is lower than the retail price. That extra cost is profit for them to pay their employees and manage their facilities. Same goes for chargers. But the reason that they're still producing them is because there is demand for them. The whole supply-and-demand principle is very much in play here; if less people bought their first party chargers, then yes, they'd stop making them. It's bound to happen, especially since third parties are producing so many more different bricks, cords, etc. Want to see if I'm right? Search for \"usb-c charger\" on Amazon. Millions of results. (If you're grasping at straws here, which you probably are, feel free to correct me by saying \"there weren't millions of results. stop exaggerating.\")\n\nThey're not only cheaper, and they still mine the materials that Samsung would have needed to make their own chargers.\n\nSo. Not just Samsung's fault, and their warehouses probably don't have boxes and boxes of chargers sitting on shelves.\n\nSecond. Another commenter on this post mentioned that the majority of people who buy a phone already have a charger (even more likely, they have multiple.) There are tons of bricks in almost everyone's house, I guarantee you. It is **2021.** Unless you're buying your very first smartphone, ever, there's a VERY low chance that you don't have a USB wall adapter.\n\nIt's cheaper for them and gets them more profit. It's more likely than not that people buying this phone (remember \\~$1000) already have chargers.\n\nIf you need a charger, buy a cheap one off of amazon. Nobody said you had to pay $30 for one from Samsung.\n\n(By the way. Rumors have been circulating for YEARS about a portless iPhone. Your Galaxy Watch and/or Apple Watch have been portless for years. And look at you - you didn't die from the inconvenience! How nice.)",

That was released to fix them soft bricking iPhones, which was released to fix some other issue.\n\nWhen iOS works it's fabulous and the update structure is great, but when it doesn't it's really really bad.\n\nFor Android devices, you can downgrade if you need to. On Apple devices, they periodically deny firmware downgrades.  For example 13.1.2 was the iOS version that denied anyone to go back to any other iOS version, so if your iPhone is soft bricked and you can't get past it, guess what; you're stuck.\n\nGoogle has been trying to force manufacturers to do long-term updates.  They are slowly bringing in that technology called project mainline, which makes major system component updates part of the Play store update system, and therefore not controlled by the manufacturers.\n\nThe latest Linux kernels have five to six years of long-term support, so that means that Android devices are perfectly capable of long-term support, but manufacturers want people to buy new phones so they don't update their devices.

I currently have an Iphone 6 on IOS 11.2.2 and my Imessage app crashes and malfunctions so frequently that I only check my messages in bulk a couple of times a day and only check and reply to important things immediately. Every single time I update the phone, it slows down more and more, and more features that used to work fine on the old OS develop new problems. Same with my Iphone 4, IOS 6 was the update that killed any sort of performance that phone had. I seems like the S models are at least slightly more exempt from this.\n\nThe updates are honestly worse than just abandoning the phones.

Also, an unique trend of an open source operating system like Android is that many manufacturers can make use and adapt their own version for their devices. Once stock android is updated, it is to be adapted to manufacturers version and to each kind of device with their own functionalities. That takes time and effort in a market where competition is fierce.

Not only that, battery issues for around 400 of our clients as well. In every single one of those cases AppleCare told us that the batteries had failed and it was coincidental.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  ONE.    Eventually a software update fixed the battery issues which meant we were lied to 400+ times about battery issues.  While I I think it's pretty funny now that I look back on it, our customers are not happy and they're really still very salty about it even all these years later.  Understandably so, as they spend about 2 million dollars a year on phones as a corporation, and it sucks when mid-contract you have to spend more money when the support policy says to replace the phone even though it's software.\n\nThere is a class of Android phones called the Android Rugged Enterprise, which has you stuck on an older OS, however you are entitled to 5 years of security updates in a timely manner. 5 years.

At the end of the day software support comes in various ways, there is the major updates that will add new features normally at the expense of performance. Then there's security updates  which should be continued to be pushed out regularly for years. Then there's of course support by app developers of the version of OS you run. I would hope that Samsung and others start pushing out longer spans of security updates. Major updates are more of a nicety that can come with some massive downsides on older devices. Support of older Android versions by developers are less of a concern but eventually you'll lose support, but the phone would probably be long dead by that point.",

Honestly, Apple has just made the simple day to day things easier. Don't get me wrong, I love my Android and being able to customize it to my hearts content, but it ain't worth the daily frustration of having to go outside of my messages app to transfer anything that isn't text. Is it a big massive deal? No. Would it be a lot better if I simply bought an iphone next time around? Yes.\n\n​\n\nI've never heard of the iMessaging for android, if it allows me the same connectivity that Apple users enjoy, dope I'm on board.\n\n​\n\nOther areas, battery life is superior. My girlfriends iphone XS Max smokes my S10+ in the battery department, it's not even in the same universe, she could go 2 days with the same amount of screen on time that I can in 1 day. And the processor department, that phone performs better on every game and app I've tried. Oh, and the face recognition is way faster.\n\n​\n\nLike I said, I love my Android, they've just really dropped the ball with the carriers in the US and it's become almost anti-consumer to allow the carriers to say \"ohhh you do have RCS! but it's only with other ATT customers....\" I mean how fucked is that?\n\n​",

It just rolled out about 1-2 weeks ago, a thousand guides out there very basic need 2 apps, one from Google themselves.\n\nThe XS Max loses almost all bettery drain tests against the s10+ lol, so your device is screwed ALSO YOUR USAGE MATTERS MOST. If someone has much more light usage their device will last much longer, but you have some anomaly apples to apples drain tests using the same apps the XS Max obviously lasts less, I've seen like 5 of em lol... Again, no, gamebench who tracks FPS in games shows that Android's sustain much higher FPS on average, the reason why is because they have optimized game modes that have the device focus in on games, the s10+'s gaming mode isn't that strong but they're actually very comparable if you look it up. XCEETECHCARE did a great video on it, all OnePlus phones, Asus rog phone, any gaming phone, and Huawei phones destroy iOS devices gaming wise. Even the Huawei mate 30 pro which isn't a gaming device at all, they also have much better cooling systems so much less throttling is apparent. Yes they have iMessage, look it up, works pretty well. I know it's shocking though, RCS is here mate. \n\nSure, you also have zero fingerprint sensor, many people love the FP reader. And my Face ID is still pretty fast especially since iPhones need a swipe to get into the homescreen, this is comparing to my mom's 11. iPhones only do much better in heavy rendering tasks like 4k editing or rendering a video, something almost all users don't do and I'd quite rare.\n\nMost apps load slower on the XS Max because of battery conservative that doesn't push the CPU has hard, a12 bionic to conserve more power because the XS Max has a wimpy battery at a 3k cell. XCEETECHCARE has great videos on the XS Max, go look at them just type in that name on YouTube and speed test to go along with it.",

Shit, that would be my third samsung phone to have a factory defect if my battery is no good, not including my Note 7 I had to give back.\n\nMy evidence isn't in comparison, it's anecdotal. So I can't refute your points technically, but I can say that every single app and game I've used loads and performs better on the XS max than my phone, if there's one thing I definitely trust it's my own eyes. Mario Kart Tour loads almost twice as fast on the XS and runs smoother than on my S10+ so maybe my phone is fucked. In terms of usage, my girlfriend is on her phone more than me, I'm not making shit up that thing has a stellar battery. I had an Iphone 8+ for a brief period inbetween phones and the battery life on that was much better as well.\n\nI hate the FP reader on the S10+, it's garbagio. I use it only under extreme darkness and it still is unreliable compared to the physical buttons, but definitely better than having none at all I can give you that.\n\nMaybe I'm getting bitter, nah I'm definitely bitter. If what you're saying is true and I've got another defective unit I'm done with Samsung entirely, fool me 4 times shame on me.\n\nEdit: I just looked into \"Airmessage\" (the android imessage you mentioned) and while i tlooks great, it does require you to have an Apple computer which I definitely haven't switched teams on.

    "selftext": ">When Chicago’s iconic Lollapalooza music festival kicked off, thousands of fans poured into Grant Park for four days of live performances. But one man, unable to secure a ticket, found a hilariously unconventional way to enjoy the show from the comfort of his own balcony.\n\n>From his high-rise residence, the man had a direct line of sight to the distant festival grounds using his phone's powerful zoom (Instagram/brianredefine)\n\n>Instagram user Brian shared a now-viral video showing what, at first glance, looked like a grainy, low-quality stream of a Lollapalooza stage. The caption read: \"When you can't go to Lollapalooza but have a Samsung.\"\n\n>As the video begins, viewers can barely make out the performers on stage as American singer Dominic Fike performs. Then, in a moment of surprise, Brian zooms out, revealing that he was actually filming the festival from kilometres away, across a sprawling view of Chicago’s skyline.\n\n>From his high-rise residence, he had a direct line of sight to the distant festival grounds, and his Samsung’s powerful zoom brought the far-off stage into view. The sudden reveal had many viewers doing a double-take.",

That 5,000 mAh battery sounds huge, but does it really last longer now, or is it about the same as before? For heavy users who game, stream videos, and scroll social media all day, is it enough to get through a full day without constantly charging? And for moderate use, does it stretch into a second day? Also, how effective is the 45W fast charging and the battery protection features like the 85% charge cap? Anyone noticed real differences with the update?",

Someone tested it by editing a human face crater onto a low res image of the moon and the Samsung device returned a clearer photo of the moon, but retaining that face. In other words, the end result is a enhanced version of the EXACT moon you were looking at that night.

In fact, less optical zoom paired with a larger sensor, wider aperture, and higher megapixel count (like the Vivo X200 Pro’s HP9 at 3.7x) can outperform higher optical zoom. Samsung tried a similar approach but couldn’t fit a large enough sensor and aperture in the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra. Since shorter optical zoom ranges make it easier to accommodate bigger sensors, Samsung could have gone below 5x. However, they for some reason wanted to keep the 3x 10MP sensor and couldn't adopt a shorter optical zoom than which would've made them difference between the 2 telephoto lens negligible, they stuck with 5x.",

If it had at least an expandable storage option, it would not have been as bad.\n\nEach cutback individually is not so bad by itself, but add all of those cutbacks plus the 1k launch price means it will very surely alienate anyone who is even remotely enthusiastic and knowledgeable about tech.",

I also loved how it somehow managed to let me avoid accidental touch activation despite having a curved screen.  Oh, and let's not forget the notification LED and the iris scanner, which Samsung dumped in its chase for more screen real estate.\n\nSeriously, at that point, what is there to complain about?\n\nI truly think that this is the end of the line for the Note series.

Everyone is fixated on it and we should have appropriate do not buy warnings there. But 20 ultra is one of first times in a while if ever that we get an soc bump in snapdragons world so that's nice. I think Samsung is moving away from specs game and sticking to \"experiences\" similar to apple. Im dad the note is get so much flak this was my potential return to Samsung from apple land. Now I'm not sure if I'll be able to and the longer I stay in apple land the more I become stuck in that garden. That beautiful beautiful but very very walled garden.",

The first seller of this was when samsung made a 3k dollar zflip that was part of a New York fashion brand as a special edition. You pay an extra 1000 dollars for Stripes printed in the back glass of the device and custom keyboard sounds. Just like how supreme make you pay thousands of dollars for a shirt that shows a minimal effort design of the word \"Supreme\" written inside a red box. You could literally create that design in google slides.\n\nAnd this is what becoming a fashion company is doing to samsung, and honestly I agree they are doing it horribly. My Galaxy a70 has the exact same screen specs as the note 20, and my a70 cost only around 350 dollars. Like c'mon Samsung, even supreme uses the highest quality cloth on earth.\n\nAnother thing to mention, apple, a company known for their ridiculous prices, on their 350 dollar phone, it still has a glass back. And despite all the horrible things apple does, like degrading the phones on purpose with each update, at least until the first update you receive after buying, apple is legitimately a better deal than Samsung, and it's been said here already, but that is not good.\n\nI hope Samsung sees all these complaints, not just here, but complaints in general, yt reviews, reddit forums, etc, and I hope they notice that this is not the path they want to go down.",

The thing is though, idk if there is a way to fix that probelm but if there isn't then it'll always be a detriment against going fully touchscreen for gaming and controllers will always have a place in gaming. Then again, even if we did go touchscreen competitives or gamers would always rather opt for mouse and keyboard or a controller over a touchscreen with all the problems with them. The good thing about touchscreens though is that they are great for casuals or simple games as most casuals struggle with traditional control schemes at first.",

If all else fails, seek emergency help and call 911.

Her father was trying to pull her out like she is a chicken wing. \nThen 2 other people joined em and starts pulling. Kid was screaming in pain when her legs r strapped in the rubber Chasity . Then I rushed in, I thought gravity could help. I turned the swing upside down. Voila , she was able to push out now with her leg. I’m still proud of what I did. Might have saved her legs 😎 Being an Immigrant in Sydney, I felt like I did something that day.

If the Note 7 battery in that unit has been replaced with the safer version then you might be fine, but other people might still not necessarily trust it (on reputation alone) because it wasn't a good hardware release from Samsung. ",

ChromeOS is good as well.\n\nGoogle Maps is an incredibly good service but google's constant refreshes of the design confuse users, especially those less tech savvy, without adding any new features or improving the experience in any way. \n\nAnd lastly, Google Live Transcribe is cool but not really worth discussing...",

I love the OS, features, flexibility, etc, but always come back to iPhone because I still have some of the same issues I have every time I switch (some of the reasons are just small OCD reasons).  It never fails that I get random stutters for seemingly no reason, no matter what I troubleshoot. Downloading any new apps (not in any way sketchy apps) will randomly present battery drain issues.  The battery seems to deteriorate faster and I always run into increasingly bad lag issues down the road. I shouldn’t have to randomly factory reset such expensive devices or constantly clear out caches to keep it running anywhere near as smoothly as the iPhone counterpart.  The standby time also kills me on Android. \n\nI come back to iPhone because I don’t have to troubleshoot, I don’t have to clear caches, I don’t have to endlessly customize to make it run optimally (because I can’t customize nearly as much), but it just works the way the it should out of the box. Battery life is great, screen quality is great, camera is great, app quality is great, and the biggest issue I’ve ever had on iPhone is my current one with a few random apps force closing and a few random Wi-Fi disconnects for no reason.  I would switch back to Samsung in heartbeat if they could match iPhones fluidity consistently, iron out the performance issues, had a better answer to proprietary messaging/video chat/etc, and could just get SnapChat to work the way it should....Until then, my OCD will always bring me back to iPhone.",

Just not the same as the OS the phone was designed for (iOS 5 or 6?).\n\nSure you get new features, cool. What do you LOSE performance wise though? There's always that to consider.\n\nWhy do you think Windows XP machines can't run Windows 10? It just wasn't meant for the hardware to do so. \n\nYou could lose performance. Battery life. Apps could malfunction. Is it likely? Not really. Possible? Very much so.\n\nAnd really Android has had some of these features in these OS revisions for a long time. They weren't as polished as iOS but they were there (and we can still customize our phones, come on apple!)\n\nI use both because they both have advantages.

I was able to get $800 for trading in my 2 year old s10 along with the additional $200 credits (cant wait to upgrade from buds to buds pro!) + smart tag. So it really comes out to only $200 for my s21 ultra! I really love the design of the note 20 and s21 phones as well, especially the matte bronze and silver, which is just an added benefit! So normally while I definitely would not consider upgrading from the s10 to the s21 at full price, due to all the things I lose, I think a huge thing  to consider when valuing and buying the phone would be the offers it comes with. Just wanted to bring this up since I don't see many people including this when weighing pros/cons. It sealed the deal for me!",

        "body": "This is a fantastic question. Actually I find the smaller sizes are too small for me now. I work as a Samsung Experience Consultant. When I get customers who upgrade from a S3 or a S4 to the S10 or Note 10, it's amazing to feel and see the difference side by side. I hold the old devices that I remember at the time were always pioneers in their field... I think \"man, look how far we've come in technology. How did we make it back then??\" Thinking back, I dont remember struggling to get used to it. It just got normal.And I remember we are all human, and what works for me may not be what's best for you. But in my opinion, the S9+ has been my favorite personal device so far. And after playing with the S20 Ultra at work, it does feel a little tall but not as heavy or thick as I expected it to. My opinion may evolve after using it more. Hoping to buy it in the next year. I am very excited for the Ultra. Not so much for the Plus or the S20, but both are equally outstanding devices too. I'd advise playing with each device, holding it with one hand at a time. Get a feel for it before choosing which size feels best. If you prefer the S8/S9/S10e size, choose S20. Like the S9+/S10/S10+? You'll like either the S20+ or the S20 Ultra. And if you're like me and wanna try something a step up, the S20 Ultra is the upgrade to jump to. No matter what you choose, even the S10 lineup is still good and now price reduced, I'm sure you'll find the phone for you!\n\nIf you want, Samsung offers Skills Workshops. You can find one for your area, and even if there isn't a class you want you'll find out who to go to. Then you could stop by their location and I bet they will be thrilled to help out. I know I try to make every upgrade a good experience. It's only something you have every two or three years, for many folks here it's been 10+/15+ years. :) hope this helps!",

The main reason I did was because my s7 was slow and all of the apps were optimized for newer phones, so they would crash frequently. My only gripes with the phone are the curved edges (i just don't get them, they make good screen protectors MORE of a pain in the ass to install and they add surface area that cases can't protect), the stupid bixby button that reactivates itself every few updates, and the fact that the screen replacement is more than my car note.",

So, no point. Also, it's impossible to get apps to actually shut down, no ability to stop access to data for any app.\n\nAlso, privacy and ads. If you have anything in your phone, Google sells it. Which is cool for customization if AI, and ok Google is so much better. But not enough to justify a total compromise of my privacy. Also, Google puts ads everywhere, and Android makes it  easy to do that.\n\nBut the big kicker for me is that galaxy gear sucks.. I didn't even realize how shitty my watch was until I was shown all the stuff the apple watch can do. It's everything that I wish my watch could do. Sadly, the watch I have is better looking, but the dial in the apple watch is awesome. The hardware on Gear is great, but the software sucks ass.\n\nI mean, the list goes on.. but, bottom line is that, yeah apple is hella consumer, but they have their shit together. It's a solid product.\n\nI'll probably get the next flagship they have.",

I just think the 'oh you'd never get this with Apple/Google/Other OEM' meme is so stupid since it's been there forever.\n\nAdditionally, at least the flexibility of android allows you to ditch these apps that provide ads, or even boycott Samsung altogether.

Now that Samsung Pay partnered with SoFi I suggest opening an account to have a backup card that is guaranteed to work.\n\nP.S. I see a lot of international friends a bit confused about the meme so let me help y'all out a bit 😆. Contactless payment is not a norm in the US mostly due to dated terminals that use MST tech. Since Samsung pay uses NFC and MST it's compatible almost everywhere here in the US which is why we can use SP in places that Google/Apple pay wouldn't work.",

Whenever I pull out my Samsung phone to attempt using Samsung Pay, everyone, I mean literally everyone behind the counter just assume my phone is an iPhone.  \"We don't accept Apple Pay\" is a phrase I constantly hear all the time, everywhere.\n\nJust like other posters mentioned, I don't want to be in a situation where I am holding up the line and look like an idiot if somehow Samsung Pay does not work.  It gets worse if I have to take my time and energy to try to convince whomever behind the counter to allow me to try.  Many times they flat out refuse and waste more of my time and energy.\n\nAt this rate, I am thinking, \"it's just easier and faster with no hassle or stress to just use my plastic card instead.\". \n\nSomeone mentioned Asia being way ahead in terms of mobile payments, and I can definitely vouch for that.  In South Korea, Samsung Pay is accepted everywhere there is a credit card terminal, with a very few exception here and there rarely.\n\nWhat's even cooler is in how people pay each other.  No more writing stupid checks and having to deposit and then having to wait a few days for the check to clear.  No more of those half-baked online transfers that take days for processing.  Instead, it is simply a matter of asking for the other person's bank and its associated account number, and BOOM!  Instant transfer and instant funds availability through the mobile banking app.  Even during weekends and holidays!\n\nCompared to that, just everything is slower in the U.S.  Customer service calls wait time, any visits to any offices of any kind (looking at you, DMV!!).... just all slower.\n\nYou'd think large retailers should encourage the use of contactless mobile payments at a time like this while the pandemic is still going strong.  You'd think people who work in retail should know about Samsung Pay by now, which has been in existence for.....how many years now??",

Even though our banks have yet to support Apple Pay, we’ve moved quite thoroughly to contactless. \n\nAnd beyond that, our government has made a massive push to e-Wallets, giving financial incentives to sign up for one and even providing a competent government-backed solution that’s tied to a physical NFC card.\n\nMeanwhile, I study in the UK where I use Apple Pay for my laundry, and even purchasing basic things like a 50p sheet of paper at our Campus art shop.

Send it in, they'll send you a refurbished one, that may or may not have more intermittent problems than your first phone. Also, if it wasn't backed up, you just lost everything on it. \n\n>I don't get advertisements here in Australia. From what I've read it's USA only.\n\nConsider yourself lucky. Here in the good ol USA, even our gas (petrol) pumps scream ads at us the entire time we're pumping. It's one of the reasons I will not put up with it from a device, is because it's so rampant elsewhere.\n\n>Samsung are now doing 3 years of OS upgrades and a further 2-3 of security updates. Also we have been getting monthly security updates for years now.\n\nThis sounds like it improved a little. Are they still almost a year behind releasing major OS updates? This could be another US problem, but since Samsing let's the carrier ~~customize~~ bloat the hell out of the phone, in addition to all the bloat they already add to Android, it was usually almost a year before OS upgrades were released.\n\n>Well this is purely subjective lol.\n\nTrue. I am a function over form person, so if a larger bezel means it works better, and is better protected from damage than a tiny or non-existent bezel, I prefer the bezel. I understand there are people who believe the phone looking great is more important than working great, I just don't understand them. Most of my Samsung devices were the S \"Active\" series.\n\n>Depending on region and carrier, the more bloatware you get.\n\nStill Samsung's fault for allowing it. If Google with it's 3% Market share can demand carriers leave the phone alone, Samsung with well over 20% could do the same. No carrier in their right mind would refuse to carry Samsung products if they made that demand.",

The S7 finally got Oreo in late June of 2018, and it was an update where Samsung decided revenue was more important than customer satisfaction, because it came with so much notification spam. I believe I had to turn off Spam notifications in 4 places in Samsung Health, then there was the Samsung store, the Samsung Game Launcher, the Galaxy watch app, the Theme store, Samsung Pay all had default set to spam actual ads (not just set me up nag screens, ads for unrelated products) to notifications. If notifications were turned off before the update, they were turned back on by the update. Plus it came with extra bloatware. Probably what delayed it so much was them trying to cram ads into anything possible.\n\nBought a Verizon Pixel 3 a few months later. I get updates within days of public release, and have never had a single spam notification (although Google does start you off with a few nag notifications about setting up various Google services, I don't consider that to be an \"ad\" on either system).",

(Most end of transactions require you to press a button to let the card reader actually tender the money, if cash then hit cash button and then you get a number pad to enter the cash amount.)\n\nSo maybe the card reader was doing it’s hard-coded thing when it receives the nfc signal, but without the register authorizing the card reader to make a transaction (as the “credit/debit) button hadn’t been pushed????) when she hit the button AFTER you scanned your phone, the card reader wasn’t down. \n\nFor a second I thought “but whenever I put my card in before they press the button it still works”\n\nBut I’m a fucking idiot who forgot the card is IN the reader still, of course it’s still gonna work at that post haha\n\n\n\nOverall I have little actual study in how Samsung pay etc function, so I’m ballparking.",

It is different tech to NFC. \n\nIn markets where swipe is something you only see in old films - samsung does not provide this technology.\n\nThe confusion seems to that when presented to cashiers they think you are trying to use NFC contactless and that is why they say it will not work.\n\nAgain if you live in a market where swipe finished over a decade ago - these conversations make little sense without the additional context because you have never likely had such a conversation.",

    "title": "Switched to iPhone After Years of Android, Here's My Honest Take",
    "selftext": "I've used Android phones all my life, mostly Samsung devices. Seven months ago, I decided to try the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nRight off the bat, I can say there’s only one thing I truly loved about it: FaceID... and that’s about it.\n\nHere’s a list of things I didn’t like:\n\n* **No “Close All Apps” Button:** I miss having a quick way to close all background apps instantly.\n* **The Keyboard is Awful:** Compared to SwiftKey on Android, the iPhone keyboard feels years behind. Even after downloading SwiftKey on iOS, it’s not the same - there’s no option to resize the keyboard, and in some apps, SwiftKey randomly disappears, leaving me stuck with the default iPhone keyboard.\n* **Keyboard Sounds Are Buggy:** Sometimes, the sound of keypresses is randomly louder or glitchy, which is extremely annoying.\n* **Inconsistent Back Gesture:** The back gesture on iPhone is not consistent across apps, and that’s frustrating.\n* **Cursor Placement:** On Android, I could just tap anywhere in the middle of a word to place the cursor. On iPhone, I have to rely on holding the spacebar for cursor control, which is slower.\n* **Alarm:** On Android, when I set an alarm, it shows me how many hours are left until it goes off. iPhone doesn’t have this feature, and I really miss it.\n* **Email Notifications:** On Android, I can read an entire email from the notification bar. On iPhone, I can’t.\n* **Apple's Interface:** It's great having good hardware, but what's the point if the User Interface is so frustratingly slow? I even enabled \"Reduce Motion\". I get it, the animations are smooth and cool, but the Reduce Motion feature should get rid of all of the animation steps to a setting that I searched for or clicked a shortcut to - and it doesn't. Also scrolling on iPhone is painfully slower when trying to move from the bottom of a page to the top compared to Android.\n* **Customization:** Most of you are probably tired of hearing this over and over again, but I got to say this. All those pixels, and I can't even change how many apps there are on my screen. My grandparents wouldn't care for sure, they wont even be able to see smaller icons, but I care. I would like to have more apps on my screen, smaller ones. I don't want to be limited, when there are better alternatives on the market. It's like buying an expensive car, but then you find out you can buy another one from a different brand, for the same price, which has a ton of more features, but they're both advertised as \"supercars\".\n\nI could go on for an hour listing more reasons why for me, Android is better than iOS. Can’t wait to switch back - I’ll probably grab the Galaxy S25 when it drops.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Anyone else had a similar experience?",

I can say that iOS is not user friendly, I understand people get used to it and it becomes second nature but the fact still stands that iOS is backwards and not user friendly.\n\nOne of the things I dislike the most is the lack of a universal back button/gesture. Also dislike you can't simply tap to place a cursor in between characters and the lack of a universal select all when highlighting a word. Another big one is the crappy notification system on iOS, the way it groups notifications and how it allows (or doesn't) you to dismiss them. Not mention all the glitches that I've encountered like apps freezing, keyboard  disappearing etc.\n\nAndroid just does things in a more straight forward way and has much more intuitive user interface and experience. It feels like iOS has evolved much much slower and grandfathered in poor user experience choices so as to not alienate part of the user base or leadership is lazy and prefers legacy. Apple should just copy the best practices from Android like its notification system.\n\nThe only good things iOS has from most  important to least is FaceID, the MagSafe ecosystem, and FaceTime/iMessage. Google had something similar to iMessage but has kept abandoning apps and adopting new ones instead of consolidating them and sticking to a single app name like Google chat...multiple missed opportunities on their part.",

It's such a pain to organize them and find a photo that you're looking for. Backing them up to a Windows PC is another disaster if you do this frequently. Their naming scheme is also weird af. Whether it is a photo you took, a random image downloaded from the internet, or a screenshot, they're all being named sth like \"IMG\\_0000\". Once I had more than 9999 photos in my iPhone, it started to name photos like \"IMG\\_0000 (1)\". What a freaking dumb way to handle file names. 🤦",

An app on the list has permission to be open by the operating system to complete tasks. Such as a podcast app waking up at night and downloading new episodes. Or an Adblock downloading new definitions. Otherwise, these tasks have to run when you launch the app, which is starting from scratch rather than resuming. \nBecause of the silly trend of swiping all the apps away, Apple has actually had to program in the ability to have apps still open in the background and not break the processes because they incorrectly think it helps to OCD them all off the screen. They just run much less often than they could. \n\n> Keyboard sounds \n\nPeople leave those on?\n\n> cursor placement\n\nYou can just grab the cursor and place it anywhere.

I was slow, always looking for things to find on em. Not saying it’s better than Android just saying it’s different, so probably that’s your problem too, just got to get used to it\n\n- Keyboard sounds are indeed buggy but my phone is on silent constatly for years, so never hear them ever. Buggy or not they are annoying anyhow.\n\n- Back gesture as in swiping the screen so it goes back a page? Never had a problem with that\n\n- Cursor placement: you can use it by tapping the screen and holding it, a magnifier will come up and you can move it, or the spacebar mode yes, both methods work, no problems with either for me\n\n- Alarm: I mean sure, sounds pointless, but sure they could add it\n\n- email notif: If I want to read it completetly that is because I want to answer it. And for that I’d open it anyways. What do I get by reading it in the notification instead of the app? Idk, but sure they could add it\n\n- Interface: i don’t know what you mean, on 120hz models it’s super fast, and Android still has the choppy scrolling problems on any phone even flagship Samsung ones, while on an iPhone if you scroll it scrolls smoothly\n\n- Customization: are you familiar with the concept in marketing, where having less option actually get you more customers? For example at burger places, if you have 2 option you are rolling in orders, when there are 300 options people just stop caring because too many choices. I feel the same with my phone. I don’t WANT to customize it, give me a fix framework which I’ll believe is the best the engineers could come up with, and I’ll learn it and use it. Never had a thought of “hmm wish I could customize this or that”. Just give it to me as is, and it’ll be good. Of course, to each their own. All of my iPhone user friends say the same, “why would I want to customize?”. It’s good as it is.",

Even after downloading SwiftKey on iOS, it’s not the same - there’s no option to resize the keyboard, and in some apps, SwiftKey randomly disappears, leaving me stuck with the default iPhone keyboard.\n\n\\> I think it's mainly muscle memory. I switch regularly between my S24 ultra and 14 Pro max. And every time it takes some time to get used to it. It's mainly due to the formfactor of the iPhone.\n\n* **Keyboard Sounds Are Buggy:** Sometimes, the sound of keypresses is randomly louder or glitchy, which is extremely annoying.\n\n\\>keyboard sounds? My phone is almost always on silent mode.\n\n* **Inconsistent Back Gesture:** The back gesture on iPhone is not consistent across apps, and that’s frustrating.\n\n\\>This is an issue for sure!\n\n* **Alarm:** On Android, when I set an alarm, it shows me how many hours are left until it goes off. iPhone doesn’t have this feature, and I really miss it.\n\n\\>indeed, a handy feature.\n\n* **Email Notifications:** On Android, I can read an entire email from the notification bar. On iPhone, I can’t.\n\n\\>My opinion is that (lockscreen) notifications on iOS, though more cluttered, are way more visible then on android\n\n* **Apple's Interface:** It's great having good hardware, but what's the point if the User Interface is so frustratingly slow? I even enabled \"Reduce Motion\". I get it, the animations are smooth and cool, but the Reduce Motion feature should get rid of all of the animation steps to a setting that I searched for or clicked a shortcut to - and it doesn't. Also scrolling on iPhone is painfully slower when trying to move from the bottom of a page to the top compared to Android.\n\n\\>iOS appears to be slower than android. But if you for example open apps on android and iOS at the same time you will see that they open as fast or faster than on android. I find that navigation true my iPhone goes faster than on my S24 ultra. The latter \"feels\" faster because animations are quicker. But it's mainly a mind trick.\n\n* **Customization:** Most of you are probably tired of hearing this over and over again, but I got to say this. All those pixels, and I can't even change how many apps there are on my screen. My grandparents wouldn't care for sure, they wont even be able to see smaller icons, but I care. I would like to have more apps on my screen, smaller ones. I don't want to be limited, when there are better alternatives on the market. It's like buying an expensive car, but then you find out you can buy another one from a different brand, for the same price, which has a ton of more features, but they're both advertised as \"supercars\".\n\n\\>indeed, iOS has a long way to go on this part.",

Anyone who’s been using 1 for years and switched to the other hates it. When customers tell me they have used iPhone for years or Samsung for years I always tell them to keep what they are used to",

The default setting is to autocorrect messages even on send, which feels absolutely wack to me. It also doesn’t seem to adapt to my vocabulary.\n\nImo Android has much, much more intelligent design overall, both UX and UI wise. The only gripe I have about it is that the UI has felt slightly stagnant ever since Android 5.0, but it’s no biggie.\n\nEhh, for what it’s worth though, I get similar functionality to YT Vanced through side loading, so I’ll probably stick to iOS now. I had (dumb) personal reasons to switch from Android, and although those aren’t really big factors for me anymore, there’s something nice about how my choice of phone kinda reflects bigger life changes.",

The iphone has been so \"streamlined\" exactly because it has none. It's not a phone you \"buy\" and \"own\". It's not YOURS. It's the phone that Tim Cook LENDS you for 1.5k usd. You remember when microsoft switched from \"My Computer\", to \"This pc\" with windows 10, people asked why? The popular (and probably most accurate) answer was \"Because if you installed win10, this computer is not yours anymore\". Apple was built on this principle from the very start. It has one advantage, sure - iphones have a \"longer lifespan\", than most android phones. Even years later any iphone will work more or less the same as it was when you got it, unlike androids, that tend to get slower, the OS tends to bloat, so on and so forth. They achieved it by making like... 70% of the \"phone itself\", it's core, it's OS and inner workings, inaccessible. It ALLOWS you to make calls, messages or install SOME apps, if they come from a designated store. But other than that - it's not yours. It lives it's own life 80% of the time. Step to the left, step to the right - \"your\" phone is a brick, your warranty moot, go fck yourself. Apple is a literal epitome of \"brand enslavement\". You're not supposed to customize it. The corp has a designated department that will decide for you how your phone looks and works.\n\nYou say this phone will be perfect for your grandparents? It's because old people are the target audience. Well, not on the surface, but if you think about it. Let me reiterate: it's aimed at people with \"tech-savvy\" level of the elderly. The main aim in it's design is to work (more or less) smoothly even in the hands of a complete braindead. What customization do you expect to get lol.\n\nWhat I really am worried about is that samsung has been mimicking apple more and more in the recent years...",

        "body": "Got an iPad some months ago. My pain points:\n\nSame as you with inconsistent back gesture... one app (even a paid one!) Doesn't allow you to go back to the main manu unless to swip (not sure if up or down anymore... always forget it) on the bottom side but not directly on the edge of the screen but like 5cm in. And no you don't get a cycling back button that would have more than enough space. And no nobody tells you how you get to the main menu!!!!!\n\nOnly unlock the screen by pressing the one button on the screen instead of swiping over it or doing anything else...\n\nOpening the \"open apps\" view is also a pain. Sometimes the swip gesture works. Sometimes not...\n\nGetting images into an app from my phone.... first upload the image to my nas, then copy from nas to iPad. But no you can't just copy it directly into the gallery. First copy it in some random folder somewhere hidden in that device. Then having the folder and gallery open in parallel and drag and drop it WTF?!?!? And then... just then can I open/import the image in the app.... because fuck me I guess...\n\nCloud sync... pain to get it disabled everywhere. Backstory: i got the iPad from a family member who also had one and wanted to share some paid apps. So he logged in on that one to do so. When I got it I disabled all the syncing stuff I could find because I don't need anything beeing backed up or saved at Apple.... and my kids will get it so I set up some of the display time settings, restricting app usage and so on. Just to get notified that the iPad from my family member ALSO has all that settings enabled now. I searched through the settings and find one that should disable the syncing of those. But I couldn't do that on mine. It just wasn't toggleable. But was on his... grrrrrr\n\nAnd as an additional to those app restrictions. I set a limit of 15min for some apps. After that time you can just click \"add some more time\" or \"disabled for today\" WITHOUT pin or any other security measures. But to change those settings i would need one. Like why do you even give me the option to limit stuff if my kid can just ignore it????\n\nYeah... thats it so far. But I haven't used it much outside the mentioned usecases... airdrop seems nice... thats it",

It appears for 7 months you’ve used an iPhone as an android user and didn’t even try to understand a fundamentally different os, only perceiving it through a limited scope of an android user. You’re not supposed to close your apps, you close them only in case they’re unresponsive, the os manages them all for you. Some will say “But battery life-…” it takes more power to start them back up again than to resume an app that is managed by the os in the background. What android users are used to being done manually is completely automated by the OS\n\nIn some places android is better, in some - iOS, most of the stuff is just **different**. Just like you can’t come to android with and iPhone mentality and then complain that “android is extremely inconvenient, I have to close apps myself, as they slow my phone down and use battery, os doesn’t manage them effectively 🙄🙄”. They achieve the same goals, just differently. \n\nThis also applies to the keyboard, I used android for the most of my life (almost always Samsungs) and for the life of me, the keyboard always felt atrocious, I keep missing the keys, while on the iPhone keyboard I can type literally without even looking at it.\n\nIm planning on switching to S24U as I recently switched back to windows from Mac and I just can’t get the “user must always be in control” mentality that’s engrained in me out",

When I was downloading and using ringtones, my iPhone friends were asking how I did it. When I was using my fingerprint to unlock my phone, my iPhone friends were very interested. The same goes for face recognition and many other features. Apple had the first smart phone, but Android was first with a lot of features. When Apple finally got those features and made a big deal out of them, Android users laughed because we'd been using them for years.\n\nApple restricts just about everything on their devices and leaves little to no room for personalization. When a new model comes out, it's the same as the previous one but with a different number and a higher price tag, yet iSheep run to get them. I can also buy a charger from literally anywhere. But if iPhone users don't buy one from Apple, their charging ability is throttled. \n\nAnd what about when you have an issue? I can go online, submit a claim, and have a new device the next day. iPhone users have to make an appointment at a store, take their phone in, wait for someone to attempt a repair, and get handed either the same device back or a refurbished one. I had a Z Fold 3, and they were out of stock, so it was replaced with a new Z Fold 4.

Every time I try to use my iPhone the thing that gets me to stop is ridiculous bugs in the OS or insane bad UI designs that drive me nuts. That keyboard sound glitch when it happens makes me think I’m using a cheap knock off phone from temu. It’s been happening for at least 5 years and Apple couldn’t care less to fix it. Oh yeah and Face ID is awesome. Why can’t Samsung properly copy this already?  That said I’ve been using my s23 ultra 80% of the last 20 months over my 13 pro max. Definitely get the S25 ultra!",

There's even MagSafe stickers that convert non-MagSafe phones or cases. I don't think it will be long before Android phones have it built-in, either.\n\nI've done video calls on my Androids for years. It's built into the contacts, just like FaceTime. iPhones can send me a FaceTime text invite which opens a web-based version in a browser, but that's cumbersome and doesn't work well. I can't send them a FaceTime call. I can however video call them, as long as they download Google Meet. There is no comparable FaceTime app for Android. And they can call me through Meet, all in the app, no browser web-based nonsense.\n\nWho needs iMessage, anymore? RCS is so much better, and it's universal.",

Shutter Delay you can fix with GoodLock but shutter lag is a software issue that has been ongoing since years now. Even the slightest movement with the subject and my image turns out blurry due to slow shutter speed. Also photos look soft and processed, especially the skin tones. Sometimes the auto exposure leads to background lights turning out all white. My wife's Pixel is so much better and doesn't have these problems. Heck even my old iPhone 12 didn't have these problems.

        "body": "The argument around “close all apps” on Android versus the lack of an equivalent feature on iPhone revolves around how each operating system manages background apps and system resources. Here’s a breakdown you can use in your discussion:\n\nKey Points About Background Apps\n\t1.\tBackground App Management Differences (iOS vs. Android):\n\t•\tiOS (No “Close All” Feature): iOS is designed to automatically manage background apps using its memory management system. Apps that are not actively in use are put into a “frozen” state, where they don’t use CPU or drain battery significantly. Force-closing apps on iOS can actually hurt performance because reopening those apps uses more resources than leaving them in the background.\n\t•\tAndroid (“Close All” Option): Android gives users more control, including the “close all apps” feature. However, modern Android versions (like iOS) are also built to manage memory and battery efficiently without needing manual intervention.\n\t2.\tImpact on Performance:\n\t•\tClosing all apps rarely improves performance on either operating system because:\n\t•\tCached apps in memory speed up reloading when reopened.\n\t•\tForce-closing apps requires the OS to restart the app entirely, which uses more CPU and battery than resuming from a cached state.\n\t•\tExceptions:\n\t•\tIf a poorly optimized app is actively running in the background, consuming excessive resources, manually closing it might help.\n\t•\tIf your phone is low on memory (RAM), manually closing apps can free up resources temporarily.\n\t3.\tBattery Life:\n\t•\tApps left in the background don’t significantly drain battery unless they’re actively performing tasks (e.g., GPS tracking or playing audio).\n\t•\tConstantly force-closing apps and reopening them can drain more battery than leaving them idle.\n\t4.\tWhy Android Has “Close All”:\n\t•\tAndroid caters to a broader range of user preferences and hardware. On devices with limited resources, “close all” may feel like a practical way to regain control, even if modern Android is designed to handle this automatically.\n\t5.\tPlacebo Effect:\n\t•\tMany users feel that closing apps improves performance because it appears to free up RAM or clear clutter. In reality, modern operating systems are designed to manage this efficiently without manual intervention.\n\nSummary Argument\n\niOS avoids the “close all” feature because it prioritizes user convenience and battery efficiency by relying on its advanced memory management system. Android includes the feature to cater to user preferences and situations where manual control feels necessary, though its modern OS also doesn’t require it. Closing all apps is rarely beneficial and can sometimes harm performance and battery life.\n\nIn essence, both systems are designed to handle background apps in a way that minimizes the need for manual app management, even if user habits suggest otherwise.",

On top of that, even though the graphics department(s) where I work use the Apples, our work PCs are all Windows and I do use stuff on my phone for work to the extent of multi factor authentication, Outlook (Microsoft 365 etc.), etc. (I try to limit myself to just necessary communication as I am an hourly paid employee). Everyone is free to choose their phones, but Apple isn't for me phone-wise.

I listen to music all the time on my phone using a very comfortable pair of OTE Sennheiser's that I invested in for the specific purpose of listening to crisp music. A phone without this port, for me specifically seems silly because not everyone uses the phones in the same way. It feels like a pure money move. When we got rid of floppys for CDs there was a distinct series of advantages for it and it happened after many man years of the two existing together. The wireless headphone scenarios are definitely not comparable in that same regard. Wired headphones are still king of sound today and tomorrow, the present is now, the future is later.",

Either way, I know for me specifically, as an S9+ owner, I most likely will be looking towards another company for my next product as I no longer feel Samsung wants to stay on top with their product (after seeing the new note as well) as much as they want to focus on their margins.",

Samsung gallery with significantly more editing and formatting options (not Snapseed but better than native). Samsung pay with MST and NFC instead of Google's NFC only. Plus!!

Hurting a company creates negative effects world wide throughout their supply chain hurting millions of workers. This COVID issue proves that. When both prosper it will have a positive effect on the entire industry.",

Lasted me a year with a smaller screen than the S6 and then the motherboard basically acted like the battery was faulty and wont work unless it's plugged in. Bought an S8 refurbished for $200 a few months ago and it's been an absolute pleasure to use.

Of they were to somehow bring back group play from the S4, perhaps they can rebrand it with something-share, but i don't think we need that feature anymore. Something else is already implemented. I forgot the name.\n\nSometimes having brand names roll off the tongue easily can get more people to be comfortable and familiar with it, and then use/recommend it till it has widespread usage. This is how you conquer. Ubiquity/mass usage. Get em hooked and dependent, make them unaware that alternatives exist.",

I get that the top model with all crazy features is expensive but the base models barely justify their high price imo. We just developed a resitance to those prices cause they now seem normal to us but they shouldnt be. Spending over 1000€ for a phone to use for mostly social media scrolling is just way to much. Samsung is just adding their brand-tax and to me it seems like their turning into Apple of the Android market.\n\nThough I must say, the preoder bonus is nice. The problem is: you cant justify a phones price by their pre-order bonus cause most people will buy them later down the year.

Seems it's about $60 a month data plans across the board with Unlimited Starter, Unlimited Extra, and 9GB plans. Even their Unlimited Elite has a $55 discount for just one line -- all their plans have varying discounts for one line and just lock you in at $60/month + Gov fees and taxes + installment. \n\n\n\nMy family's on the T-Mobile Magenta plan with their 2+1 for free deal (two lines @ $35, 3rd line's free) with a $5 autopay discount.

    "title": "Switching To Iphone Has Been The Worst Decision I’ve Ever Made",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI want to share a public service announcement for anyone considering switching from Samsung or Android to iPhone. Please be aware that many influencers often overlook significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nI have used Samsung my entire life, but I decided to try the iPhone because it has a better camera and image processing, and many people praised it. So, I traded in my S21 for an iPhone 16 Pro Max, and I've regretted that decision ever since. I encountered several unexpected issues from the first day I received the phone. Here are just some of the problems I’ve experienced:\n\n- **No clipboard**: You can only copy one item at a time.\n- **Cannot close all apps at once**: You must close them individually.\n- **No split-screen app support**.\n- **Cannot take long screenshots**.\n- **Custom ringtones**: You cannot set a custom ringtones without using a separate app.\n- **Restarting the phone**: You can only turn it off; restarting requires knowing a code obscured in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power).\n- **Volume control**: You cannot adjust volume settings individually for media, notifications, and calls in the drop-down menu.\n- **There is no universal back button or gesture** so swiping left to right will often not bring you to the original page and will not work on some apps, like YouTube.\n- **No adjustable screen rotation**: If you want to watch content in a rotated orientation, you have to turn off the rotation lock, rotate the phone, and then turn it back on. On Android, a button allows you to rotate media without changing the rotation lock.\n- **No pro camera controls**.\n- **RAW images still have processing applied**.\n- **File transfers**: You cannot transfer files to a computer without using iTunes or other software.\n- **Clearing notifications**: Clearing all notifications doesn't remove recent ones.\n- **Apple Maps is inadequate** stores and restaurants lack first-party ratings.\n- **No video wallpapers**.\n- **There is no number row on the main keyboard page.**\n- **Siri is not as useful as alternatives like Gemini or Copilot.**\n\n- **Alarms set don't tell you how many hours left**\n\nFortunately, I purchased the early upgrade plan, so I will trade in this phone as soon as I can. I hope this post helps others make a more informed purchasing decision.",

This is what I'd add to this list:\n\n- no long screenshots\n\n- no option to silence all app notifications at once. You have to change this setting in each app's settings. I'm not talking about putting the phone on silent, but setting all apps on silent, while phone calls vibrate and ring.\n\n- keyboard is a mess. I hate how it corrects my last word when I hit \"send\". I want the message to send the way it is when I'm hitting \"send\". Also no numerical row should be a criminal offence.\n\n- modes and procedures are very limited. I have a procedure set on my Galaxy that enables screen rotation and puts the phone on don't disturb when I'm opening video apps like YT or Tiktok. Can't do it on iPhone.\n\n- speaking of screen rotation - on Galaxy, you can disable automatic rotation, and then when you physically rotate the screen to landscape - you'll see a button that lets you rotate manually. Not to be found on iPhone.\n\n- one hand use - you can customize your huge Galaxy S Ultra to be quite easy to use one handed with One Hand Operarion+. I use left-down swipe from the right side of the screen to open notifications and quick settings. On iPhone, there's no way you can set such shortcuts.\n\n\nI kept asking my company for this phone and I wanted an iPhone specifically since I wanted to see what it's like without having to pay for it. I'm so thankful I did it, and will never make this mistake. Now that I'm not even traveling for work, it's just collecting dust.",

I just switched to the iPhone 16pm from s22 ultra. \n\nYou can create a shortcut to have the restart button or even a whole menu of different use case for your action button. \n\nApple doesn’t really need to turn off the apps like android but I agree, it is incredibly stupid that they don’t have a close all apps button. \n\nNot sure about the Bluetooth, mine connects automatically but on and off I have some connectivity issues but that seems like my earbuds issue moreso than the phone. \n\nAn app I recommend to make full use of pro features is the black magic app. Give it a look esp on YouTube. \n\nThe media volume button is stupid but you can activate the volume control to manage both media and ringer through the settings. \n\nTransfer files, I use telegram. It’s not too crazy. \n\nFrom your list, the media control and the universal back gestures are the biggest obstacles to cross. I’m perfectly fine or at least adapted to the other stuff. \n\nDefinitely good to know as a Samsung user that might want to convert but each person’s threshold varies. Im quite happy with the iPhone but is also because Samsung feels the same to me after using it basically for 10 years plus while iPhone is a fresh experience. \n\nHope you find a better time with it or with a new Samsung phone lol",

Also the base iPhone models lack a lot of key features like the 120 hz screens, AOD, use old USB C technology etc. Which cannot be justified. The worst is that people using an iPhone still try to justify these lack of features by saying things like: you don't see the difference or you don't need this and that. In my opinion it's criminal. Iphones are like a status object, but in reality it's nowhere near that. Also the whole ecosystem argument is nonsense.

I've heard that SwiftKeys' iOS version is also a lot worse than the one on Android.\n* The maximum indoor brightness is about 20% of the Samsung's with \"Extra brightness\" toggled on.\n* Even though according to the official \"Human interface\" UI/UX guidelines, most apps (even the native Apple ones) keep on cramming most actions at the very top, making them very hard to access on the larger phones.\n* Notifications dismiss backwards and I can't get used to it. Also, I have to break my finger to pull down the notifications shade, as the swipe down has to happen precisely from the upper corner of the screen.\n* All animations, even though superb in execution, are too slow. Scrolling is infuriatingly slow too. The animations are a literal bottleneck for the 120hz screen.\n* I really dislike FaceID compared to a fingerprint scanner.\n* I have to double tap the Power button and scan my face each time I want to use my credit card with NFC.\n* The camera is technically better in almost every other way, yet, ultimately, the blander screen colors and the blander photo colors, result in very soulless photos when viewed on the phone. I prefer the vibrancy of Samsung.\n* Waze in Android Auto looks and functions like crap, for some reason.\n\nBut yeah... No universal back gesture trumps all of them in terms of stupidity. When I use iOS I feel handicapped.",

Processors these days are good enough and apps running in the background are frozen and don't use any capacity from your phone. In fact, it's better to have them frozen in the background so the phone doesn't have to load the app from scratch when starting, it can just grab the frozen state which makes app usability much faster.\n* Not natively but same as number 1, I've never had a use case like this. However, there are apps that allow split-screen functionality.\n* Nah, you're wrong here, there's a full-page screenshot option:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7iktnw9zkkhe1.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a5318d78eefbcf5f85d7b1e333daf2eecc467d3\n\n* I mean you can, you just have to buy the song you want to use from iTunes but for everything else you can use GarageBand which comes natively on iOS or any third-party app.\n* True, never understood why.\n* Same as number 6.\n* You're wrong here, just swipe from the left edge of the screen to the middle and it will bring you back to the previous point in any app.\n* At least for videos, you just have to go into fullscreen and even when rotation lock is on, the video will rotate.\n* No clue about photo stuff.\n* No clue about photo stuff.\n* I mean you can use iCloud, but what's the problem with that? Is it because you can't just connect it to your PC and use it as a USB stick?\n* It should work if you swipe up again to merge them into the older notifications.\n* I don't know where you're from but Apple Maps uses TripAdvisor or other local rating sites when TripAdvisor has no entry. Or what do you mean by first-party ratings?\n* The VideoToLive app allows any video to be used as wallpaper.\n* Siri is terrible.",

        "body": "\nI think there are only a few truly unbearable aspects of iOS, and they mostly depend on personal habits and needs.\n\nIn my case, the crippled multitasking is a real pain. I can’t just sit there staring at a screen for minutes while waiting to send a video, upload a file to the cloud, wait for an app to refresh its content, or simply post a reel on social media.\n\nThen there’s the iOS keyboard, which I find terrible. It wouldn’t be a big deal—since I don’t even like Samsung’s keyboard—but on Android, I can change it. On iOS, I technically can, but the alternatives are restricted and don’t work properly anyway.\n\nAnd the browser? On iOS, you use Safari. Or Safari. Or Safari with different skins.\nYeah, that really annoys me.\n\nOther than that, it’s just pros and cons.\n3/4 of the issues op mentions can be worked around or are simply due to different habits. Switching the other way around, I see similar struggles. iOS definitely has its strengths… and Android has others.\n\nHonestly, the two systems have never been closer, constantly copying each other. Years ago, the differences were way more noticeable.",

But it didn't seem to be the case. I was an original iPhone guy for years who never owned an android. I got a OnePlus 10 Pro while I was working at T-Mobile and I loved how it felt to me as if I had just got out of phone prison. Anything I could think of doing, there wasn't a restriction or a charge for. The app organization on iPhone is horrendous, and I never knew any better... But OnePlus sucked in terms of support, durability, and update rollout. I almost went back to iPhone for the lack of support. Then I decided hell, let's not fool around and go for the top dog. $1,000 iPhone vs $1,000 android... I got an S24 Ultra. It was exactly what I needed to stay. I'll never go back to iPhone, there are so many stupid things about it.",

The free Garage Band app is difficult to work with on  a phone.\n\nBut also  \n\\- File transfer is easier now with the Apple Devices app  \n\\- You can set a timer instead of an alarm to know how much time is left (I know it's not the same).\n\nBut  \n\\- Apple Maps has come a long way and is preferable in a lot of instances, specially urban areas. \"Not at this light, but at the next light turn right\" is way more helpful than \"in 800 feet, turn right\" there are 4 intersection in that span. do I have to chance it. you can even put both at the same time.

I agree the design is really good but in a practical sense the closely controlled Apple system restricts users.  For example the Apple system offers no advice if you try to do something it can't do. Apple \" It just works\" only if you do it the Apple way. \nMy 2c worth your mileage may vary.",

My SO's phone was ending it's life and so we decided it was time to get her a new one. Only this time it would be an iPhone. A decision we massively regret. \n\nAnd it was a brand new one and it's not defective, but it's just a terrible experience compared to Android. \n\n1. For starters it has its own **proprietary connector**. Which means in both cars, 2 cables are required. Then she has her own charger at home. Obviously also needed one for work - so that was just extra money down the drain. \n\n2. The **repeatability** of actions generally sucks. Even basic things like unlocking the phone sometimes works - other times not. So weird nearly a year in and neither of us have it figured out yet. \n\n3. Some apps that are actually very good and available on Android don't have iOS equivs. \n\n4. There was an issue with Tailscale that one month ended up eating up all her data in a few hours. Now I know this isn't an iOS specific thing, but here's the thing - it didn't happen on Android now did it? \n\n5. The experience of using it just somehow feels clunky. \n\n6. Impossible to fully integrate google services with it. You can sort of get there, but it's not possible to get all the way there. \n\n7. The find my phone feature when viewed from a web browser on a PC doesn't even automatically update. You need to log in and out to get it to refresh. This is the kind of low quality development you get. \n\n8. All the bleeding edge customization features coming to iPhone are about 10 years old now in the Android space. \n\n9. It's just that every time I look at that phone I see something in another ecosystem that doesn't really belong in our house. \n\n10. Carplay is quite primitive compared to AA.",

No clipboard: You can only copy one item at a time.\n\nSolution: iPhone has a clipboard, but it only stores one item at a time by default. However, you can use the Notes app, Apple’s Universal Clipboard, or third-party apps like Paste or Copied to manage multiple clipboard entries.\n\n2. Cannot close all apps at once: You must close them individually.\n\nCounterargument: iOS is designed to manage background apps efficiently, so closing them all isn’t necessary. iOS suspends unused apps, reducing battery and CPU usage. That said, a full restart can clear all apps at once if needed.\n\n3. No split-screen app support.\n\nCounterargument: While iPhones don’t support split-screen, Picture-in-Picture (PiP) allows video playback while using other apps. iPads, however, do have full split-screen support.\n\n4. Cannot take long screenshots.\n\nSolution: You *can* take long (scrolling) screenshots on Safari, Notes, Mail, and a few other Apple apps. In Safari you can navigate and find it by tapping the up arrow button. In unsupported apps, third-party apps like Tailor or Stitch It! can be used.",

I made the switch to android after my Iphone 6's life ended (I loved that phone) and being pissed off they removed the aux jack on the new iphones.  \n\nSwitching to android was a change, but I got used to it. Biggest frustration was being left out of group chats because people don't like being in group chats with androids. It's apple's fault for not playing nice with androids but people don't know that, they just know that group chats with androids suck. \n\nAfter being shamed by my friends and fiancees for years, and not my fiancee not being able to share her location with me when she's out of town, I finally broke down and switched back to Apple this Spring, after my S10e was nearing it's end of life. \n\nI can NOT get used to the lack of volume control. It pisses me off so much. Every thing you listed is true, but the volume control is driving me absolutely bonkers.  \n\nI want my media volume defaulted to silent. I hate scrolling social media and my phone starts to play some video loudly. I also want to be able to adjust my ringer volume on the fly. Sometimes I want it silent, some times I want it quiet, some times I want it loud. \n\nAlso, I NEVER want my alarm to be quiet. It should always be loud enough to wake me up. \n\nWith the iphone I can't adjust media volume until its already playing. So I can't preemptively turn down the volume before a video plays, because that just turns my ringer volume down. I learned recently I can have the ringer volume not controlled by the volume buttons, which solves the problem of adjusting media volume before it plays, but now my ringer volume is one set volume.  \n\nAlso, I have to make sure to turn my volume UP before bed so my alarm is loud enough. Completely unitiuitive because I don't want to be disturbed while I sleep. Yes, you can set your phone to silent and still have the alarm go off, but you still have to turn your volume up. If my volume is low, I won't hear the alarm. I'm 6 weeks into owning this Iphone and I'm still trying to get used to this insanely simple yet complicated volume control. \n\nJUST GIVE ME MULTIPLE VOLUMES TO CONTROL LIKE ANDROID, HOLY SHIT.",

        "body": "I'm very accustomed to Android and every time I need to use iOS I find some things to be incredibly irritating. However, as someone with a MacBook for work and a gaming PC at home, I cannot agree with you. MacOS is 10x times more intuitive after you get used to it.\n\nJust a very small example - apps in Windows go through whole wizards with multiple clicks involved in order to install. And then they're tied to registry keys which can go corrupt or deleted, causing a ton of issues. MacOS apps are self-contained and they install with a single double click or drag 'n drop. They uninstall the exact same way - right click > \"Move to trash\".\n\nNot to mention optimization, lack of drivers, a miles better Terminal that gives you control similar to Linux, but only if you want to engage with it (unlike Linux), etc. Things like HDR just work, Spotlight (alternative to Windows Search) has worked super good for years while the one in Windows has only just started being somewhat useful, etc. etc.\n\nThe only things that MacOS can just not deal with is peripherals. It hates your non-Apple headphones, it hates your non-Apple mouse (although the Logitech ones fare pretty good, bar the inverted scroll) and it definitely hates your multi-monitor setup. I'm lucky enough to have gotten used to not needing any peripherals apart from my Airpods Pro, though, and the Mac's display, keyboard, trackpad, and even speakers, are class-leading in my eyes, so I'm pretty happy.\n\nIf it wasn't for gaming being non-existent on a Mac, I'd not touch Windows with a ten-feet pole ever again.\n\nP.S. Nothing can beat the M ARM chipsets in Macs on a laptop yet and it's not even close. Windows is catching up a bit now, but slowly, and more than 4 years late to the party.",

Custom ringtones: You cannot set a custom ringtone without using a separate app.\n\nSolution: You can create custom ringtones directly in GarageBand (pre-installed on iPhones) or use iTunes to transfer them. It’s a little extra work but still possible without third-party apps.\n\n6. Restarting the phone: You can only turn it off; restarting requires knowing a code obscured in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power).\n\nSolution: Holding Power + Volume Down for a few seconds brings up the shutdown menu, where you can simply turn the phone off and turn it back on.\n\n7. Volume control: You cannot adjust volume settings individually for media, notifications, and calls in the drop-down menu.\n\nSolution: While iOS doesn’t have separate sliders in the Control Center, you can adjust them individually in Settings → Sounds & Haptics. Also, when adjusting volume, different sliders appear based on the active function (e.g., media, ringtone).\n\n8. No universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right doesn’t always go back.\n\nCounterargument: iPhones use a \"swipe from the left edge\" gesture to go back in most apps, but yes, some apps (like YouTube) override it. The back button on the top left of apps is always an alternative.\n\n9. No adjustable screen rotation; no rotation button like Android.\n\nSolution: iOS has Smart Rotation Suggestions (on newer iOS versions), which appear as a button when rotating content. You can also enable AssistiveTouch to get a quick rotation button if needed.\n\n10. No pro camera controls.\n\nCounterargument: The stock Camera app is designed for ease of use, but third-party apps like Halide, ProCamera, or Filmic Pro give full manual control, including shutter speed, ISO, and focus.",

Other apps I installed did have a Windows-like set-up, and others are just hanging in your Downloads folder until you drag them to Applications yourself.\nFor deleting apps you have some apps that can be deleted through the launchpad -shaking when you long press them-, others through Applications (even there I've been running into apps that did not want to be removed, and appearantly I have some uninstallers as well according to a quick Spotlight search.

But if you don’t still up for it, the good thing is you can return it or even sell for a relatively high value and go back to Samsung lol. \n\nWhatever you feel comfortable the most or enjoy is the most important! It’s just a phone after all. If you given it a fair shake, nothing wrong with hopping right back.",

However, apps like Lightroom, Halide, or Darkroom allow you to access the untouched RAW files.\n\n12. File transfers: You cannot transfer files to a computer without using iTunes or other software.\n\nSolution: You can transfer files via AirDrop (Mac), iCloud Drive, or third-party apps like Documents by Readdle. For Windows, the Files app in iOS 17 supports USB file transfer without iTunes. If you are on Mac, an easy way to transfer photos and videos is by using the native Image Capture app. \n\n13. Clearing notifications: Clearing all notifications doesn’t remove recent ones.\n\nSolution: If some notifications remain, it’s because they are pinned or ongoing alerts. Long-press them individually or disable persistent notifications in Settings → Notifications.\n\n14. Apple Maps is inadequate; stores and restaurants lack first-party ratings.\n\nCounterargument: Apple Maps has improved significantly, but Google Maps is still superior for ratings and reviews. If needed, you can just use Google Maps instead.\n\n15. No video wallpapers.\n\nSolution: Live Photos can be used as animated wallpapers. Though not full video wallpapers, they offer a similar effect when long-pressed.\n\n16. There is no number row on the main keyboard page.\n\nSolution: iOS has QuickPath: swipe down on the top row to type numbers quickly. Alternatively, third-party keyboards like Gboard add a persistent number row.\n\n17. Siri is not as useful as Gemini or Copilot.\n\nCounterargument: Siri is more privacy-focused and integrates deeply with Apple’s ecosystem. While Gemini and Copilot are more advanced in some AI tasks, Siri handles device automation better. iOS 18 also brings ChatGPT integration as well that’s available now. \n\n18. Alarms set don’t tell you how many hours left.\n\nSolution: If you use Siri to set an alarm, it does tell you how many hours remain. For manual alarms, a workaround is using the Clock app’s Bedtime feature, which visually tracks sleep times",

Certain combinations of actions will result in choppy animations whereas that never happens in iOS.\n* 'Wake on motion' is less responsive which makes it more difficult to access lock screen shortcuts.\n* Face unlock is much worse.\n* Auto correct behavior is annoying. In iOS, if I don't like the auto correct I can hit backspace and it will undo it and allow me to continue typing.

Of you think about it, the pen makes a lot more sense with the giant inner display of the Fold, and Samsung already has too many models, they need to simplify their lineup.

I have note 10 plus I love it but if they replace it with the foldables I'll be delighted. For the average person the spen inside a foldable is a significantly more productive experience than the note phones. Like I said I have one and I love it but its really not that great anymore and overall is not an intriguing edition to the market. I would simply say if your defining feature can be replaced by a case with an spen slot, you might wanna change to something else to bring interest (ie. Foldables)",

Top of the line specs, best camera, biggest screen, powerhouse flagship, etc. Now that the Galaxy S line is so similar to the note (basically no difference but the stylus now), Samsung's probably decided it's not worth making a whole separate line of devices when their Ultra lineup has done a fairly good job of selling as their most premium/powerful device. It makes sense from their perspective to merge the product lines together by adding an S pen to the S21 ultra. The only downside here I guess is a lot of people would like to buy the ultra but might have no use for the stylus.",

So from a manufacturing cost standpoint, there really isn't anything that makes the Note series stand out anymore apart from the S Pen which means they could cut costs entirely by just adding S Pen support into the Ultra and removing what is essentially a refined Ultra especially when Samsung has too many product lines already. One could also see it as Samsung assimilating the Note series into the S series. They also transferred the title of super premium eyecatching phone to the Fold series\n\nTL;DR most people buy the Note for its hardware, specs, and the experience it brings, not necessarily the S Pen itself so from a manufacturer's standpoint, the Ultra's there already. It wouldn't make sense to spend more money making a different product line that offers what's already being given by something in your inventory",

        "body": "Don't kid yourself. Google is so far behind in its own OS  it's not even funny. Samsung had split windows on the galaxy s3 that came out in 2013. LG had it on the the LG g3 or g4  Google didn't add multi windows till nougat which was 7.0. Google has never supported micro SD cards even though they put code in Android to support it. They have and will never give users a slot on the sim tray for one. They want you to buy extra Google drive storage. they even took away the unlimited storage for Google pixel 4 users and their pictures at full resolution if it was taken on a Google pixel phoneNor did it support USB OTG properly until about the nexus 5x and 6p days. Google's apps are garbage. It's Google play movies and TV app don't play movies one has aquired in questionable ways or ones you shot on your camera. Google play music is terrible. From user interface to user experience. YouTube app is horrible. YouTube vanced is much better. Gmail is garbage compared to Samsung mail and Inbox which Google killed for no reason and never implemented Inbox's  features to Gmail like they said they were going to. ever since they came out with the pixel lines and their phones have been plagued with so many issues that they never fix.  they've learned very well for Apple. Google makes the shittiest phones and they charge you the most for them when you can get twice the features out of a Samsung Motorola LG budget phone. The only thing I will give Google credit for is there camera ever since the pixel 3a and 3aXL their camera is phenomenal but that is about it.",

Like, if you have to sync with your company app or Dropbox instead of iCloud, you couldn't do it without \"location services\" or it just wouldn't work. I wonder if that has changed. Plus, I always noticed and still notice weird glitches on the iPhone that require restart. For example, suddenly the microphone would stop working or iMessage wouldn't respond. Somehow, the software is more stable on Android, which is surprising to me.\n\nOn Android, I can allow background running with all sorts of restrictions and conditions if I like.\n\nI also keep my family on iPhones because Androids are less common in America and I need them to have stuff that other people will also be on. More importantly, for \"simpleton\" phone users, iPhones are best.\n\nMy parents have 4-5 year old iPhone 6S Pluses where the batteries are starting to wear down. But, they can get a battery replacement for $120 total for both of them. Or, they could switch to the next 2022 SE.

Upon hearing the question I felt my heart rate shoot up because I didn't know what to answer and didn't want to talk bad about the guy, (even though her suspicions were indeed correct). In the middle her questioning she receives a phone call and I immediately began measuring my heart rate and stress level. 135 BPM with stress levels shooting all the way up. The watch is amazing.",

The thing that made me feel off was how elevated it was above the back of the phone.\n\nI would trade the discomfort for the 120Hz display and the camera performance. I mean honestly, I saw a handful of 120Hz phones and the OneUI animations look stunning at 120fps. More so, the phone didn't feel sluggish even though it was sporting the craptastic Exynos chip.\n\nThe zoom in was silly though.

That's actually why people make apps that tell you to unplug your phone when you reach around 80% (80% being the average charge that puts the least amount of strain on your battery). However, some phones have this pretty much built in where your battery isn't even at 100% but really at 80% which would be your 100%.\n\nIt's also bad to let your phone die as well. You should never really let your phone go under 20%. \n\nHowever, these wear cycles are so small that it often doesn't matter until a few years down the line when the wear has accumulated enough to you to notice \"hey, this phone's battery got worse over time\".\n\nSome phones, like the recent announcement/release of one of Sony's phones has the ability to pause battery drainage during gaming and actually allows you to charge directly from the wire. So your battery will stay at like whatever percentage you last had before opening the game, and then all power will the come from the wall. This way, the game can use as much power as it wants from the wall, without discharging your phone or wearing the battery. Once unplugged, it'll switch back.",

Your debit/credit card has a contactless chip in it and Samsung, Google and Apple pay all use that same system. \n\nThe only difference here is the limits (which have changed due to COVID anyway) but historically debit cards had a lower limit as they were less secure... As in, in theory if someone found your card they could start making Contactless payments... But Phone pay systems have added security. \n\nWhen a store here says they \"Support' Apple Pay or Google Pay it basically just means their terminal will let you pay for (I think it's..) up to £150 of goods using your phone as opposed to the (I think) £50 regular limit.",

In a peaceful act of defiance I asked if I could just try since there wasn't a line. She was reluctant and said yes but I noticed that she hadn't totaled it on her end because it also wasn't asking me to insert my card nor asked to confirm the total. I pointed that out to her and she gave me a glare while once again stating that it simply would not work. She totaled it, my screen gave me the amount, I confirmed it and touched my Note 10+ to the side(where you would swipe). \"BEEP\" transaction approved. It was like her world stopped. She printed out the receipt twice because she was in disbelief and I had to show her the part where it says \"Last 4 digits for cashier\" and she didn't put the receipts down for minutes... I attempted to explain how the MST worked but she didn't seem interested and told me to not use that in her store again. I told her I understood and to have a good day.\n\nThe second time was quite some time ago and at a cool store where they sell board games, collectables, and an impressive selection of PS2 games among many other fabled retro games. Respectively, they've got an ancient register that's probably my age and somehow still reads a card swipe. Once I was ready to purchase my game of choice, I inquired if they accepted card and then proceeded to ask if I could attempt to use Samsung Pay. He chuckled a little bit but was happy to partake in my experiment. Totaled it up and I reached over to where he would swipe my card once he was ready. After a brief moment, it went through and he immediately got concerned and looked over my receipt. I explained why it worked but told him that I was honestly surprised it did work based off how much plastic was in the way and how old the register was. We both laughed over our amusement and wished each other a good day. 😎",

So even if someone were to steal your phone AND figure out your passcode, someone who has fingerprint authentication setup on Samsung pay can rest assured that the thief at least can't use their credit/debit card. \n\nI'm not saying it's impossible but them saying that it's a security issue sounds BS.

    "selftext": "Seriously, they keep raising the price of the phone higher and higher and somehow it's worse than the competition. The consumer is going to pay $1000 for a plastic back, 1080p 60hz, and non expandable storage?\n\nYou know what else has a plastic back and 1080p 60hz? The pixel 4a for $349. Paying $1000 is ridiculous.\nEven my S6 had a 1440p screen with a glass back when it shipped new, 5 years ago. For $600. \n\nSamsung seems to have adopted the Apple mindset of having a premium brand and paying more for less. \n\nAnd let's not talk about the steep price of $1299 for the Ultra, which is genuinely a good phone but why are they basically forcing people to upgrade to the bigger phone by creating one of the worst values in a smartphone ever. Oh that's right, money. Even iPhones look like better value at this point. \n\nNot to forget that people are seeing ads all over their premium flagship phones. What's to say that this $1000 and $1299 phone wouldn't have ads in a year or two.\n\nAlso Exynos chips. I dont need to say anything else on this, you get the point.\n\nLastly, ~~2 years~~ 3 years of software support is laughable at this price point. $1299 and $999 for phones when it's only getting supported for ~~2 years~~ 3 years. And we the consumer support this practice because we have no choice if we want Samsung.  \n\nI was looking to the Note 20 for a replacement to my S8, but it seems like I would have to live with Android 9, which sucks because the S8 is still a beast once I replaced the battery.\n\nEdit: Just found out it got changed to 3 years of software support, but still terrible compared to Apple's 6 year support. At least it's a step in the right direction.",

Additionally, you get for that price only three major OS updates and you usually have to wait for it for a long time. \n\nAnd then there is Exynos. The US smartphone I believe will get newest Snapdragon 865 Plus and in Europe you only get the same Exynos that S20 had, which was worse than Snapdragon 865. But somehow the Tab s7 gets the Snapdragon, so why a 1000$+ phone cannot?\n\nEdit: apparently Samsung will now give three major OS updates",

Here is my thought about it:\n\nAbout  plastic back:\n\nFirstly, I don't know since when metal back or glass back is better than plastic back? I think the back material only about handtohch feelings. Oneplus first model was using a super nice plastic back and in first model of Galaxy serious also using plastic back, with no one argue about it. until Apple bring the sandwich struct to cellphone, all people try to follow it, and start to despise the plastic.\n\nSecondly, I think weight is more important for now. Sine the battery can not replace in smartphone, everyone try to fill in large battery in phone, cause the cell phone weight is over 200 gram now. I don't know how to feel those weights with have a stronger and bigger hand palm people, for me is too heavy. If someone willing cut the phone weight with replace the glass back, I think I will say yes.\n\nAbout screen solution:\n\nMany test agency was said about high refresh rate is fundamentally big change about smartphone. I was bought the Oneplus 7 Pro AMOLED with 90Hz refresh rate and made by Samsung and iPad Pro with 120Hz refresh rate version.\n\nHere is my conclusion about it, I do not think high refresh rate will help much about normal user experience, because when quick rolling content you can feel the difference and using Apple pencil write down somethings, you can feel the time lag. Otherwise I can not feel much difference in normal things.\n\nBut side effect about battery life it can not be ignore it. Even Samsung only to reduced clarity for high refresh rate, I don't think that is fair deal.\n\nThis is all about personal feelings. Samsung flagship phone is not about hardware, only issue is software, Complicated UI settings, unreasonable heat and battery unreasonable drop is all troubles for me to using the Note 10.",

And that means the phone does not deserve a \"premium\" price tag.\n\nThe biggest problem with this phone is the PRICE.  Had it been priced right, there would have been no complaints.\n\nWhat Samsung should have done is to forego the \"Ultra\" motif.  The Note 20 Ultra should have been just Note 20.  The regular Note 20 should have been Note 20 Lite, accepting that it is NOT a \"premium\" device.  They could have opted for cheaper and more energy efficient Snapdragon 765G chip, to lower the price point even more, and price the phone at a much more competitive level.\n\nOR.. Samsung should NOT have cheapened out with the build quality and storage.  128GB base storage WITHOUT SD card expansion and WITHOUT higher storage option is NOT acceptable for a \"premium\" phone.  Plastic isn't bad and has its advantages mainly in durability, and most people use a case anyway.  But it isn't just the plastic back that Samsung cheaped out on. They even put in inferior screen compared to last year's Note 10 series.  Too many compromises and yet... they are selling this phone as a \"premium\" device with a \"premium\" price tag.\n\nSo yes... the regular Note 20 is a BAD buy at the initial launch price.  With the right price drop, the phone could be a good buy, but at that point, the excitement of the Note 20 series launch would wither as newer phones with better specs would come around.\n\nSamsung really screwed things up big time.",

The Note4 in short was absolutely no compromises. No Note4+ or any BS like that. Just one Note4 and it was truly the best.",
