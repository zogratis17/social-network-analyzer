Keep aside your ego and inferiority, if u live for 2-3 years, try to learn little by little, we don't want you to be absolutely fluent in our local language, least these people can do is respect the local language and culture and make efforts, try to adapt. I saw some vids of social experiments where a guy asks fare to an auto driver in Hindi, the auto driver says it insanely high but the other guy who asks to go at same place in kannada, auto driver literally quotes him the half price. See people are warm and welcoming and if u make efforts to adapt their culture and language, they feel more affectionate. \n\nI recently went on a family trip in Kerala and I used some malyalam lingo and tried to speak in malyalam with locals, I know it wasn't correct but most of the people smiled and corrected me.",

However the real message of Vembu in the interview is that India's educated elite is disconnected from realities of India and their roots - collective roots . Perhaps no one has even broached upon the topic cuz it is an uncomfortable truth and is also basically a non controversial topic . Any intellectual discourse on that topic wouldn't cause too much of confrontation and thus is uninteresting and won't capture too many eye balls . Or may it is too complex a topic for most people to discuss . Anyways he is right . India is a highly rural country even in its cities  and the urban highly educated minority living in its bubble has little idea of actual India and its woes and its identity.",
