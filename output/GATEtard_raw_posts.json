    "selftext": "I called my father today to ask for 500 rupees for some books, the reply from the other side of the call shattered me to my core, he said \"\" beta aaj account m 400 hi rupee h, do din rukjaa tu m karta hu tujhe\"\" , I was broken. I didn't know what to say, he's a farmer so most of his earnings and savings usually go to the day to day work in the farm and even in my college fees and hostel fees,my uncle is helping.\nI have been preparing for gate from the past month, the Idea of getting into iit for a bright future is the only solution I can bring my family to a stable condition.\nThe thing is that hearing a thing like this breaks something in you, I don't want my father to ever be in situation like this before, and no matter what happens, I will be the person who takes my family out from this condition.\n\nAny tips for the preparation is much needed and welcome.",

At the end, he had just ₹5 left — his lucky note.\n\nOn the day of Choti Diwali, my brother and I, being the careless kids we were, burned almost all the crackers like we used to every year. The next day, we kept pestering our father for more crackers, not realizing the situation. By the end of the day, he broke down and said, “Ab nahi hai to kya karu? Tum log hi batao.” (\"I don’t have anything left now, what should I do? You tell me.\")\n\nIt’s been 20 years, but I still can’t forget that moment.\n\nToday, I earn nearly ₹3 lakhs a month after tax. Ever since I started earning, I’ve made sure my father never has to ask for anything. The moment I see he needs something, I get it for him — even if I have to take a loan or EMI. Whether it’s a phone, a Bullet bike, or a car — I’ve made sure he gets what he wants.\n\nSo, work hard. Make your parents proud. That’s what truly matters.The day you'll buy somthing for your parents the kind of happiness you'll get is unparalleled.",

My father had retired, my mother was going through some expensive treatments due to her compromised lungs, so my father was not able to provide financial support to me for preparing for GATE. I had just graduated then. So, I had the choice of preparing for GATE or joining a company. I convinced myself that even though how hard you want, some things are not meant to be. So, I let go of my dream of doing an M. Tech and pursuing research work, and joined my first company. So, it all depends on your priority. After almost 3-4 years, I reached out to a professor in IIT Delhi through one of my friends, and the professor was such a brilliant person to talk to. I explained to him my situation, and after taking a very short interview then and there over phone he agreed to take me under his mentorship as a JRF. So, it would be like a dual degree (M. Tech and PhD combined course). But he said that the money will be a fraction of what I was earning then and told me think about it before deciding. I discussed this with my family and they said that it would be really difficult to run the household without my earning. Hence, my 2nd chance also was gone. Apologies for writing such a long message. But the fact that I want convey is that you have to set your priority and accordingly proceed. It's okay if you are not able to pursue M. Tech right now. You can always build up a corpus by working for a few years, so that during your Masters, your savings will be enough to support your family as well as your college life. With regards to job opportunity, please start applying to as many companies as possible. Target is to have a stable footing for yourself and your family for now. You can always ping me if you need any inputs or guidance, or even if you want to just talk, and vent yourself.",

And using chatgpt and reddit as well as telegram to get free resources/study materials. \n\nAnna-archive is a rather good site; once you get used to. Kind of slowish but works considering it's free.\n\n  \nAlso try, if possible, some part-time jobs or freelancing or anything. Obviously it will get hard to manage it all but as you get used to it, you will be able to handle misc requirements of yourself and even better if you can save it and gift something to your dad 🙆🏻‍♀️\n\nApart from that it will get usefull. Like you will know about the overall job-market early on, get used to how to deal with peoples. Can add on (if want to) in your linked-in or whatnot profile to make the resume thing more attractive. Like just write there part time while college (from this year to this; remarks, and other stuffs).\n\n  \nAll i would say is you got internet and a device, you could do wonders - there are lots of free resources, study materials, course, specializations you can do to make your profile strong (Idk what's that called; forgot but the resume thingy). Just focus on your college, do side husstles like part-times if possible, do an online (free) course/specializations weekly or monthly. Get used to ai and stuffs like excel, powerpoint and stuffs - Not just about getting used to but collecting and adding on their certificates in your profiles.\n\n\n\nIn the end focus on studying hard, and as you said you want to take your family out of that condition, good luck!\n\nIt's not a lottery thing that you would suddenly get lots of money or something, but it is rather something that would slowly unravel the path with your hard work and consistency, you just gotta hold on to it and carve your own path out of it.",

Try to aim for PSUs most importantly because unse aap acha earn karne lagoge jaldi and fir agar aapko Mtech karna h toh apne PSU ke salary ke paiso se kar paoge. Aur because aap CSE kar rahe ho toh online opportunities bahut h sikhne ko. GATE and PSUs kaa preparation aap eksaath hi kar sakte ho toh dono ache se karo. Aur baaki ke free time main Coding ke skills badhao youtube and LeetCode ke thru. All the best bro.♥️",

You could make some sandwiches and sell them outside one day, and the next day, offer your help to locals with tasks like shifting houses. Don’t feel shy, and don’t chase the money. The key is to stay active.\n\nYou could also take advantage of food offers on platforms like Swiggy, where you might find deals like pizzas for just one rupee, and the overall amount will be max 60 Rs for 3-5 pizzas. You could buy these deals and resell them to your friends for a small profit, like 50 rupees a day. Additionally, ask your college teachers, coordinators, or even the principal if there are any part-time opportunities available. Believe me, if you try your luck, you can easily find something that will help you earn some money.\n\nBut remember, don’t drain yourself chasing after money. Earn just enough to invest in yourself and improve your educational skills. Money should support your studies, not distract you from them. Stay focused on your goals!",

The reason why I am asking this question is that I have faced this issue personally during my CAT exam, where my computer started glitching and I was not able to write my exam completely. What if there happens such a scenario where you are not able to perform to your expectations and hopes. You should have a fallback plan then. Something like a backup plan or Plan B. I feel that the plan B is job for now, so that if God forbid a lowe than expected condition happens, you will still be able to support your family least, and you can take another shot next year. Think about it, if possible, and again my apologies for giving negative thoughts. However, I personally believe in the quotation that optimists build aeroplanes, and pessimists build the parachute. So, I feel that you should think about your parachute plan.",

Nada. Is her thesis on that? Believable but doubtful. Master's degree? I don't think such a degree exists at all, even as a speciality within a Master's in Aerospace program.\n\nShe did two internships? Fine. Lockheed makes sense since she went to the US, and is still improbable. But Safran? That's French, so calling cap again. Like we are being told she did one internship in the US and another in France?\n\nThen, double doctorate? Especially if she is in the US, most elite schools don't allow a second doctorate. Is she pursuing two PhDs together? Yeah, not possible. \n\nLastly, why I said improbable for some things above. Unless you are a US citizen or GC holder, you won't be allowed in Lockheed at least. Plus on top of that, Missile Tech? That's the biggest baloney here. These companies can't even offer internships for say, Aerodynamics, because even that is defence tech according to them. Missile Tech? Really? Her PhD might be in Missile Tech, but it's still very improbable and her internships just cannot be about this, even though common sense says it should be related to her PhD theme or something. \n\nThe only exception is working in JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), where you don't need to be a citizen or GC holder. \n\nAgain, with all due respect, this is all bull crap unless she is as talented as von Karman or a similar stalwart.",

ISRO follows reservation policy of government, there is no reservation in R&D (core work – EC,CS) but in ancillary engineering branches (EE,Civil,Mech) they do follow the policy; also they offer Age based relaxation and cutoff marks based relaxation to candidates belonging to reserved categories. Despite R&D being critical for organisation's progress and competency, it does not define the work culture in any organisation, they make up for a minority chunk in the organisation. Thus classifying ISRO as disobedient to reservation policy is ignorant of the real fact.\n\nThe cited post is written from the perspective of a second person, author may have observed the related person from far and scrutinizing those provided details without considering the circumstancial facts that he maybe a layman who isn't aware of details and about courses and academics is unjustified.\n\nWithout digressing from the core problem one could have discussed – how reservation is too far stretched in today's times where it could be easily dispensed with, and social momentum that our society has gained is now enough to keep the society progressing. How reservation has became a political tool in hands of politicians. How developmental issues are taking backseat while such issues become the face of elections. How at this critical juncture we are stuck in that trap of past and letting time slip from hands and not heeding to issues like bureaucratic hurdles, unfavourable ecosystem, costly credits, regional disparity...! \n\nWhy no one is discussing the fact that despite having elite IITs we require foreign architects and engineers for our world class bridge building projects!! Why there is no collaboration between elite institutions and rural base of nation?? \n\nStop splitting the hair and discuss the real issue of unfavorable environment and braindrain, and yes talent is discouraged in scenarios of reservation this fact is undeniable.",

Now only things are just imaginable that what if ISRO had best talent but it could never be possible since there would be no investment from the private sector for promoting space tech in India and even if it did had, all the talent would have been poached by US companies.",

Even if the person had mentioned postdoc it would have atleast been believable . Additionally if you are an PhD from a top US school , doing a separate PhD in the SAME field is a huge red flag , means ur PhD itself was bogus and not rigorous. \nISRO might have its own share of issues , I agree but atleast point out real faults.\n\nWhats funny is this post sounds like how ur avg Indian uncle aunties talk about core engineering.. “oh mera beta is doing double doctorate “",

Gaokao is one of the toughest exams in the world, but do ya'll know any top Chinese Colleges? No right? many chinese and indians apply for Harvard, MIT. but the reverse isn't what you see\n\nMy suggestion -> Always prefer things where there are less number of people and can provide you huge opportunities. GATE is now one of those things (Might change in near future). Most people apply for Jobs, MBA, Govt exams, or Bank Exams. I've seen less people taking GATE seriously",

After graduating, most students learn on the job, do MBA or go for masters/phd from top universities in USA and a few other countries. These international universities accept students from IIT not because they are great engineers, but they look at the IIT tag and assume they are smart students who will figure things out and make up. \nTherfore M. TECHS from IIT who did not clear JEE adv, do not belong to the cream. And the masters coursework is usually shit. So, they do not deserve the IIT tag, simple.\nAlso, most BTech+MTech dual degree students take the GATE and pass easily with single or double digital ranks.

        "body": "The term \"privileged\" in the context of BTech students at IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) often refers to the perception that these students have certain advantages, such as access to high-quality education, resources, and networking opportunities, which can provide them with a significant head start in their careers. The IITs are known for their rigorous entrance exams (JEE Advanced) and prestigious academic environment, which attracts top talent from across the country.\n\nThis sense of privilege can arise due to factors like the high socio-economic status of many students, the financial support available through scholarships or family resources, and the status of IITs as premier institutions. Additionally, IIT students often benefit from strong alumni networks, internship opportunities, and placement drives that lead to high-paying jobs in reputed companies both domestically and internationally.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that while these advantages exist, the path to an IIT is incredibly competitive, requiring immense dedication, and many students come from modest backgrounds and work hard to secure their place. Therefore, the term \"privileged\" is subjective and may not apply universally to all IIT students, as diverse backgrounds and experiences contribute to the student body. LPU offers B Tech in various streams",

Many times they have a fixed set of rules that they have to follow for grading and if a student uses some other logic, they would deduce the marks. Now these mtech  students hardly understands the subject they are grading for, many times they just blindly follow the rules. It has happened with me multiple times. In my entire 4 years, i havent found a single mtech student who actually knew a course he is being a TA of. The frustration and the fact that they can deduce mark even tho they know less than the students are reasons they get a lot of hate. Again, me not finding a TA who knew about a course more than a student doesnt mean that these mtech students do not exists, i have a theory that all of these smart mtech students probably do not apply for being a TA and just study on their own. And b tech students get exposed to these dumb mtech guys, so the hate",

Tech students have towards the M. Tech ones but everyone knows that it's untrue. \n\nHere's what the problem is - B. Tech students consider themselves to be smart because they've cleared JEE. That's utterly dumb. Define smart and knowledgeable, you people grind in some coaching ever since you were a kid to literally memorize all of the formats of the questions that might come in the exam and to no one's surprise, clear it. The truth is that, you need to understand that just like how you don't like it when someone who's less knowledgeable than you orders you, that's how the entire corporate community in India feels about you people. Go to any nation other than this country, no one will take your shit for granted and believe that just because you cleared some exam, that too, a multiple choice one, makes you smarter than them. If IITians were truly that smart, IIT would've gotten over a hundred Nobel prizes, Turing awards and stuff like that. Instead, B. Tech IITians are wage slaves and cheap labour in America who do as directed by their masters. \n\nAnd stop having this superiority complex. No one's bitter. It's not the 90s or the early 2000s anymore, sane people don't idolize IITians, only meatriders do and that too for the financial POV, not for academics. If I were to idolize somebody, I'd rather idolize some rich businessman with no degree than some arrogant dumbass who's entire personality revolves around the college that he went to.

JEE Advanced is absolutely not a rattification exam (which is why you see many top rankers like myself who had a lot of improvement just from Main to Advanced), 90% of exams I've had at IIT were not ratta exams. Courses with both JEE students and GATE always have a bimodal mark distribution because the matkas simply DO NOT have the analytical ability to perform well at the highly evidential subjects we have. Honestly as a dual degree student it was annoying as hell to finally get to graduate level courses and then it being so so boring and slow because the profs had to make extra consideration for the matkas. \n\n  \nIt isn't true that \"research/higher studies is considered to be for the weak\" here. It's just that most of us (me included) would rather try our hand getting admitted abroad and having access to more funding, better resources and a bigger job market. \n\n  \nSo please, think before you speak-- you're exposing how bitter you are about something you don't even have any clue about.",

Tech students have but that doesn't change anything. But I addressed the problem correctly, it's still the narcissism that you subconsciously posses yet don't acknowledge in order to fit in.   \n  \nFirst, you said that M. Tech performed worse and attributed that to their failure in JEE. Then, you proceeded to play it safe and say that they perform worse due to **some** reason and tried to become humble by telling me that you don't want others to bootlick you. But then again, you said the statement \"projecting your own insecurities\" exposing the condescending attitude you have towards me on the other side of the keyboard. You inherently assume that because you went to IIT and I did not, I'm always insecure about it as if my whole world revolves around people like you. \n\n\\>I mean, ofcourse the average American won't have a clue about Indian unis just like they won't have a clue about top European unis like KU Leuven either?\n\nWrong. KU Leuven isn't as popular as you might think in Europe, let alone America. As for other places, the Americans are perfectly aware of Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, TUM, École Polytechnique, KTH, etc. But IITs don't come to their mind as soon as they think of top places in Asia. The first thought would go to Uni of Tokyo or NUS. Whether that's a valid reaction or not is a different discussion but that should be enough for arrogant B. Tech students in IITs to get a reality check and understand that the world doesn't revolve around them. \n\n\\>MTech at an old IIT is a solid option and if you manage to make the cut you should definitely go for it. Hell, I'd go as far as to say that if you don't plan on going to academia, getting a Mtech from an IIT now makes more sense than an expensive masters in the US where you will have to deal with visa issues.\n\nThis isn't a question of financial ROI in Masters' in India v/s abroad, it's about giving Masters'/PhD students some respect as they're the ones who're willing to work tirelessly in Indian labs with very little facilities in order to develop the country.",

I know that foreign companies particularly select IITians too but in the native country of that company, they recruit from every university which is not the case in India. \n\nThe problematic thing is that IITians are the best slaves that one could find, statistically. These people are the definition of robots, they're gonna do exactly what's told to them and they're not gonna ask any question. Grinding in Kota helps them to develop this skill. But that's the reason most of these people rarely become innovators and end up becoming CEOs (only with the incentive of hiring more people from IIT) because they're the biggest corporate whores out there. \n\nBelieve it or not, most of the B. Tech IITians are like a totally different ethnicity, a really close-minded one which think of itself superior than everyone else even though the rest of the world doesn't even know the name of their college. Foreign nations treat IITs like really good trade schools, places to find the finest labour for cheaper prices.

I’d a rank of 3k so kinda meh but I genuinely believe like there’s no comparison in both of these exams. It’s like comparing S24 Ultra with a jio phone. Just cause the syllabus is vast (which isn’t true) I don’t think so that’s grounds for even having a comparison between the two. You’re essentially losing 2 more years of your life for a mediocre degree which in my opinion isn’t worth it. You can do so much more in 2 years that you’ll be earning similar to what a mtech guy earns and on top of that you’ve more experience. The trade off isn’t worth it.",

Another guy told the OP that he is an idiot because he won't get his fundamentals right and he won't be able to achieve anything. I felt bad for OP, so I told that guy that though he is right, he can mellow it all down a bit. In turn, he replied to me with a response from ChatGPT, and then replied again to me telling me to stop karma farming (huh?? Defending someone is karma farming. That's news). and should take farming because engineering is not my cup of tea. Well, it pissed me off. But what can I do about it - assholes - they exist everywhere, and there is no way to fix them.

By extending his logic, those multimillionaires whose kids have to practically do nothing other than show up are doing way better, for they don't have to waste a single day of their lives worrying about a job, let alone passing college, or even school. Even the kids in our school class that we were envious of as their parents already had an established business waiting for them to occupy a seat - are better off (financially) than most of us.\n\nPeople like these are those who always make everything a profit/loss situation, always comparing & arguing/displaying they're doing better than their counterparts. They can't fathom it if the latter are even equal, let alone be better than them at something.\n\nThese people generate most of the toxicity that you see in the work force, and eventually, society. Their confidence is in part, boosted by their condescension - them thinking that they're better than others & constantly finding fault in others instead of fixing their own holes or taking pride in their own hardwork & efforts.\n\nThey can never empathise. They only know to use/abuse something and someone for material gain.\n\nSo, yes, you can let it go, but don't complain when such people transform into unhealthy colleagues, co-workers, or even, your partner.\n\nContrary to the assumption, life is long. Some start early, some, way too late. But the funny thing about life is, some people can catch up way sooner than anyone can expect - so, rather than laughing at the misery of others, be a good human, and prevent the many miseries of your own future.",

One of the most rational people I know, a guy who literally hit rock bottom in life and came back up, somebody who built his success brick by brick, working 15 hours a day for 20 years and going through much worse before that-he himself knows that hard work wasn't the only thing that got him to where he is today, nor was it the most important thing. People like you who say things like \"just work hard, it's your own fault alone if you aren't successful\" don't get it in my opinion.\n\nThe government can and absolutely should be blamed for a lack of creation of jobs. Not just the current government but the earlier UPA governments too did quite badly in this respect. Discussing why would go into history, politics, economics-things I don't really want to go into.\n\nMake of that what you will. Maybe you still hold the same opinion, I don't really care since you seem like a good guy, just uninformed.",

    "title": "From Rock Bottom to IIT Kanpur — My GATE Journey (AIR < 500 in 5 Months)",
    "selftext": "I don’t know whether anyone will read this or if it will help someone, but I really want to share my story (a success story, you could say, xd!).\n\nI secured an AIR under 500 in GATE 2023 with just five months of preparation.\n\nRead my story — I hope it helps you.\n\n\n\n**Date: 4th July 2022**\n\n**My friend**: Bhai, job nahi lagi, ab kya karega? (Bro, you didn’t get a job. What are you going to do now?)\n\n**Me**: No idea, bro. I curse myself for wasting so much time. I wish I had studied. Now, I have no option other than preparing for some competitive exam.\n\n**My friend**: Hmm, I can understand. We’ve decided to go on a trip. Are you coming?\n\n**Me**: No, bro. You guys have 15+ LPA jobs. I can’t show my face there. It will be embarrassing for me. You guys enjoy.\n\n***Hangs up the call.***\n\nThat was the darkest period of my life — I had broken up with my girlfriend, college had ended, my friends had moved on and gotten jobs, and there I was, sitting in my room, staring at the ceiling, wondering what to do next.\n\n\n\nIn early August, I decided to prepare for GATE. This was my last chance to prove myself. And just to remind you of some of my “achievements”:\n\n\n\n* Failed in JEE Mains, took a drop, and failed again (scored below 70 percentile)\n* Failed in KVPY\n* Was not even eligible for JEE Advanced\n* Had 2 backlogs in college, CGPA was below 8\n* No interest in coding\n* Didn’t even know HTML, CSS, JS (never tried learning them either)\n\n\n\n**Main Preparation Story**\n\nI began my preparation in the second week of August, around the 10th or 11th.\n\nI promised myself that this time I would work harder than ever before — no Instagram, no friends, no YouTube, no web series, no calls, no hangouts, nothing.\n\nI watched online videos on YouTube, some pirated courses from Telegram, and free lectures from GoClasses. I paid for a couple of courses — only for TOC and OS.\n\n**My daily routine**:\n\n* Wake up around 5 AM (I’m a morning person, but it doesn’t matter when you wake up as long as you’re consistent)\n* Gym + walking – 2 hours (I was quite overweight, so health was a top priority)\n* Study: 8 AM to 12 PM – mostly Maths, later OS or DBMS\n* Nap + lunch until 3 PM\n* Study: 3 PM to 6 PM – mostly theoretical subjects\n* Chess + tea break until 8 PM (I really love chess, so no compromise on that)\n* Study until 10 PM, then dinner and sleep\n\n\n\nI put in 8–9 hours of consistent effort every day for over five months (from November, I increased it to 10–12 hours).\n\nI completed the syllabus by the end of December, though I left 2–3 topics like Digital Logic and Computer Networks — my biggest mistake.\n\nI kept revising and solving PYQs after every topic or subject.\n\nIn January, I started giving mock tests and was scoring 50+ consistently — enough for NIT, I thought. I was very happy at that time.\n\nI kept revising, taking mocks, analyzing my mistakes (I had maintained a separate Word document for that), and gave my last mock test on 1st February, where I scored 78 marks.\n\nI said to myself, “I have done it.”\n\n  \n**Exam Day**\n\n“It’s a normal day, bro. Chill,” I told myself.\n\nI went to the exam with full confidence. I thought, “I’ve already scored 80 in mocks — NIT is almost certain.”\n\nBut that overconfidence led to 3–4 easy mistakes.\n\nAfter the exam, I checked four questions — and three were wrong. My dreams shattered again.\n\nAt that time, no one called me, no one asked how I was. I cried myself to sleep that night and told my parents I would fail again.\n\nMy dad supported me, like always, and asked me to prepare again — it would have been my third drop (after Class 12), but God had a different plan for me this time.  \n\n\n**Result Day**  \n\n\nThe results were announced — I secured AIR under 500.\n\nI cried. I screamed. I hugged my dad. This time, we cried out of happiness.\n\nI joined **IIT Kanpur** (OBC category might have helped), and life changed completely.\n\nPeople appreciated me, called me, hugged me, believed in me. Even my ex called.\n\nIt was me who fought till the end and came out as the winner.\n\nMy journey inspires me — and I hope it inspires you too.\n\nTo anyone reading this — **you can do it**.\n\nJust put in 6–8 hours of **consistent** effort every day, and you will see results.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. I already knew **C language**, **SQL**, and **Calculus** well, which helped a lot.\n2. I didn’t take any coaching — I relied on online lectures available on YouTube.\n3. I joined **IIT Kanpur** for Mtech in CS but didn’t sit for placements — I am aiming for a PhD at IISc or at a foreign university.\n4. I studied **consistently every single day** — no breaks.\n5. I’m a pretty chill person — that helped me stay calm during the exam as well.\n\nAll the best to everyone reading this.\n\nI opened Reddit just to share this. I truly hope it helps.",

But couldn't make much.My batchmates on an avg are with more than 10-12lpa.\n\nGraduated this year.Planned to take a drop.Reasons being same as yours.I want to prove myself.I want to succeed atleast once in life.Past few years have been very very difficult for me.\n\nI've some sort of preparation for gate(got 3k rank this year)\nBut I'm worried about the questions that my mind asks which keeps me disturbed most of time, bcz of which I'm am unable to study long and self doubt myself.\n\nPlease answer.\n1. Was it all worth it? \nNot taking even some small job (5-6lpa).Giving one year of your life again to competitive exams prep.Seeing your age increasing (currently I'm 25)\n\n2. Will I be able to compete in mtech? \nBcz in btech ,I somehow passed , by doing shortcuts (got 7.5+) , but worried that mtech will have thesis work and all which I've not done in my life.\n\n3. Though not comparing but will choosing this path make me able to go above my batchmates.\nMy batchmates currently have 10-12lpa package ,sde roles etc. If I do mtech, I'll join job after 1+2 years. Will I be able to attend par with them.\n\nThankyou in advance for answering and making such a relevant post.\nYou don't know how much your story means to me.",

Also, I deactivated insta, snapchat, basically everything that distracted me before, Once I have no way to distract myself, I get bored pretty fast after lying on the bed so I get back to work because that seems much more interesting. Also, setting brutal but reachable deadlines and actually reaching them helped me a lot.\n\nAlso, don't lose motivation and don't lose self belief. Confidence is crucial in this period. If you lose confidence, you will lose motivation to study as well. So keep faith in yourself, and study every single day!!! \n\nHope this helps.",

    "selftext": " I come from a middle-class family in bihar. I wasn’t born rich, and like every other middle-class parent, mine wanted me to succeed. But honestly? I was just an average student.\n\nI passed my 10th grade in 2011 and went to Delhi for IIT prep. Somewhere down the line, I realized it wasn’t my thing—but by then, it was too late. My father used to visit me sometimes, taking me to Chandni Chowk to buy stuff. I still remember when he gifted me a Chinese phone. He had so much love for me, and I just couldn’t bring myself to tell him, *\"Mujhse IIT nahi hoga.\"*\n\nI passed 12th with good marks but completely flunked JEE 2013. Scored only 93 marks—didn’t even clear the cutoff. Getting into a decent college seemed impossible. My father was constantly searching for colleges, worried about my future. Somehow, I managed to get into an engineering college in Rajasthan, graduated as a mechanical engineer in 2017… and guess what? I was jobless.\n\nAt the time, GATE was the big thing. I prepped twice—scored 62.88 max, which wasn’t enough for a PSU. Tried again in 2019 and flunked. Cleared BARC’s written exam but failed the interview. Back-to-back failures were breaking me. I cried myself to sleep, completely lost about where my life was heading.\n\nWith my 2018 GATE score, I got into IIT for [M.Tech](http://m.tech/), graduated in 2021. I had always been good at coding but never really focused on it. This time, I gave it a shot. Learned Python, ML, AI—landed a 10k/month internship. From there, I got my first job at a startup, earning ₹44,446/month. After 7 months, I switched with a 150% hike—₹85k/month. Then a raise—₹92k/month. Another raise—₹99k/month. And now, in 2025, I’m earning around **₹1.34L/month.**\n\nAll those past struggles? They feel like a distant memory now. My father is a happy man, my younger brother is a government officer, and life… life **changes**. It really does. 🚀",

Most move abroad through iits, nothing influential like DH university grad Vinod Dham('Father of Pentium'), Kalpana Chawla, etc.\n\nThis country puts too much efforts on toughness, competitive aspect in Indian exams basically creating slave **labourers** that work 10x than others and are just to exhausted to think outside the box, everything for them money, big Data, AI, etc.. Funny thing is still top minds couldnt create anything like LLMs or AI models.\n\nI wish to work on Bipedal Robots(needs lots of funding) which is why I just have to get into this damn IIT somehow and access their designing(EDA) tools.",

Every single day felt like a challenge — mentally, emotionally. There was always this lingering fear: What if I fail? What if it all goes to waste?\n\nBut I kept going. Some days were good, most were hard. I doubted myself constantly. But now, looking back, every hour of effort, every breakdown, every little win… it was all worth it.\n\nAnd today, when I saw that acceptance screen — M.Tech (TA), IIT Bombay — I just sat there grinning like an idiot. Still am, to be honest. Hehe.\n\nIf you're in a tough spot right now, wondering if it’ll ever be worth it — keep going. One day, that screen will smile back at you too.",

    "selftext": "So I recently converted FMS, and I feel like sharing my story. I've never been great at studies scored just 55 and 70 percentile in my JEE attempts and ended up joining a tier-3 college. That eventually pushed me toward MBA, because at that time, I thought it was my only option to do something big in life.\n\nI appeared for the CAT three times. The first time, with little to no preparation, I scored 87 percentile. The second time, while working a job, I scored 98 percentile and converted some new IIMs. But my dream was always IIM A, B, C or FMS. The ROI of FMS blew my mind just 2 lakhs in fees with an average package of 34 LPA. So, I decided not to join the new IIMs, even though my parents scolded me for it. But deep down, I knew I'd convert next year and I did.\n\nThis time, I scored 99.87 percentile and finally converted FMS. The journey has been unforgettable, filled with self-doubt and hurdles, but worth every bit.\n\nAlso, you can consider the r/CATStudyRoom subreddit. It helped me a lot during my interview prep too. There are some pretty good and serious aspirants there you can join this sub as well. It'll definitely help you in your preparation journey, whether it's for the exam or interviews.\n",

Even though I had the potential and preparation to score 98+. I used to somehow screw my exams.\nMy mon cried on the day of results. Not because she was unhappy with me. But because I was unhappy.\nAfter looking at my results I scream, I banged my hand against walls. I wanted to kill myself. (Not kidding)\n\n3 years later,\nI am currently in 3rd year (tier 69 college). I had only one plan since my 2nd year. I'll make my mom cry again. But this time, of happiness. Results declared, got a score of 684, AIR 1501. I know this is not a great score. Not like I achieved something big. But, for someone who lost his self esteem. Who considered himself as a failure at one point, this is the break I needed. My mom, indeed, cried today. Infact, I too, cried today (after 3 years).\n\nThis is just to let people know, even my seniors. I think we have developed a very faulty concept of success and failure. Did I actually fail JEE? I applied almost all my problem solving skills that I gained through JEE in my GATE exam as well. If I hadn't prepared for JEE that well, I couldn't have scored more than 40 marks. Yes, maybe a lot of opportunities get closed, because of \"on paper failure\". But that is not the end. I used to never believe, but hardwork does pay off.

Time management wasn’t a big issue for me, so I didn’t stress over mock tests too much. But if you struggle with timing in the exam, I’d definitely suggest doing 15+ mocks to get that practice.\n\n**Everyone serious about GATE completes the syllabus, so what really sets you apart is retention, and for that, revision is the key.**\n\nAs for aptitude section, it’s honestly pretty easy in GATE. Don’t waste too much time stressing over it — just get comfortable with the basics and move on.",

After trying to be the best in education for the last 5 years, only recently have I realized that studying is not enough. Life is beyond just studying. I was also hyped up because I was a high scorer but now I feel I am nobody and that people are ready to stomp on you to get where they want to be. Escape this constant cycle of getting your validation from grades, our parents think that this is the only way because it was for them. Now, I am not saying to stop studying but I am saying reduce the mental burden. Think of it as you are doing a chore, get through it. Personally, I never enjoyed smoking, drinking, partying so I am okay with not having fun like that (It is not a bad way). I enjoy being by myself, detached from the outside world and all the mental pressure I get from seeing others. However, I do have someone to confide in. NOW THAT is important, find someone to talk to on a regular basis. It can be daunting, but you need an outlet, you need socializing. Break out of this loop you have had for 8 yrs (yes, you can do it). Try by changing one thing about yourself this week (It could be your hair also)",

I even wrote an email to them but nadda. That was my last attempt and I didn't even qualify for advance because of 0.2 percentile(would have at least gotten some Institute of national importance with a decent branch of my choice if that didnt happen with me). It has left it's mark on me and I still struggle with its trauma. I still want to go to IIT so I chose this path instead. I have some faith in this exam because it is under IITs and IISc and not the imbecile of an organization known as NTA. I did decently in state government exams and got a decent state government college as of now but the placements have tanked for the past and this batch unfortunately. The good thing is that my engineering will cost me peanuts and not financially strain my parents much. I feel bitter especially towards NTA because of it all, especially when I see how NEET and medical students got so much media coverage and attention but we didn't even get 10% of it in our time. I just pray and hope our exams are more fair and glitch free unlike what it was like under NTA",

    "title": "My preparation journey to achieve a 2-digit rank in GATE CS",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone. In my recent post, a few aspirants asked me about my GATE prep journey, so I decided to make a post about it.   \nI am a chem engg graduate from 2021 batch. I realised it around my final year of engg that I am not interested in Chemical at all. So after completing my BTech, I joined Cognizant at an entry level position. Obviously, the work was really boring and I saw no growth in it, so after more than 1.5 years of working, I decided to quit. \n\nI submitted my resignation on July 21st, 2023 and at the same time I paid for a Live Online Coaching from ACE Academy. Now, Cognizant being the kind people they are /s, they made sure that I work for the entire 3 months of Notice Period. So managing my online classes and job was tough for those 3 months and I somehow managed for those months. Classes used to go for about 6-7 hours at that time. \n\nOnce I was out of my Job on September 21st, I switched gears. I had more time in my hand, so I committed most of it (other than my classes) to going through my notes and solving PYQs and improving my already written notes. Trust me, updating your already written notes can help a lot. I am absolutely proud of my notes, because they are notes that are not for everyone but just for me. Remember, note-making is important so that \"Future YOU\" can understand it in an instant during your revision. So make sure that you highlight things that YOU are more likely to forget. Your handwriting does not matter to you, but what you write and how you explain it does.\n\nTime was around December, the exam was closing in but classes were still going on (obviously because I joined the latter batch). So I had classes for almost 12-14hours a day. It was absolutely horrible because it sucked all my energy to do self-study. Therefore, all I could do was solve PYQs of my incomplete subjects for about 1-2 hours a day. \n\nBy mid-December, my classes were over and I started solving full-length Test Series. This was the time when I got to know about GateOverflow and GO Classes. GateOverflow website is an absolute Godsent for GATE CS aspirants. You can find great solutions for PYQs in that website because both GO Classes faculty and other students contribute to solving problems in that website. So if one solution does not suit your style, you can always read another one that came up with the same answer from a different approach. Anyway, I enrolled for the GO Full Length Test series. I think it had about 15 full length tests, one releasing every week. After each test, GO classes faculty will discuss the questions live in their youtube channel, they will also refer to videos in their channel if you struggle with a particular topic of a question. \n\nI believe their questions are well curated and you can actually catch a few of them in the final paper. Enough d-riding, by mid-January, I was doing full length tests from both GO Classes and ACE(because it was included in their full course). I used to score 65+ in ACE tests, and about 50+ in GO Classes. So, I was not the most confident individual at that time. I thought that I might get newer IITs at best. But that didn't concern me at that time. My purpose was to prepare and get better, so I stuck with that. I started going through my notes more carefully, and started byhearting things that needs to be memorized, like the theory part in Compiler, OS, DBMS, etc..\n\nFew days passed, and it was the exam day. I was anxious yet confident, I know it sounds oxymoronic, but that's the best I can describe that emotion. I entered the exam hall. The exam starts and I start solving, and I keep solving, and I keep solving. After almost 2 hours, I realised that this is going surprisingly smooth. During the last few minutes since I couldn't solve any more question, I just counted the number of questions I had solved just for a rough estimate, I solved 61 questions out of 65. The exam was over and I had only one thought in mind, \"I fucking devoured the paper\". But then I tried to calm myself down saying that maybe this is my overconfident self speaking, maybe I am counting the chickens before they even hatch. After a few days, I tally my marks with the official answer key and the rest is known.\n\n**TLDR**:  I graduated in Chemical Engineering in 2021, but realized I wasn't interested in it. After working at Cognizant for over 1.5 years, I quit in July 2023 to prepare for GATE with ACE Academy's online coaching, balancing classes and work during my notice period. Post-resignation in September, I focused on revising notes and solving previous years' questions (PYQs). Discovered GateOverflow and GO Classes for additional test series, which helped a lot. By mid-January, I was doing well in mock tests but was still anxious. On exam day, I felt confident and performed well.\n\n**Tips**:  \n1. Join coaching if you are on time crunch. Sometimes a person understands the depth of the situation only after they spend money.  \n2. Make the best version of your notes. They are your best friend, reading other people's notes will only get you so far.  \n3. (Subjective) Do not follow anyone else's strategy, there's no guarantee that it will work for you. Try to find what works for you and stick to it.  \n4. Maintain consistency. Even if you happen to be busy on some days, just study for 30min to an hour just so you don't lose that streak that you have made with yourself.  \n5. Feel free to look for other sources if you are not comfortable with someone's teaching. I made this mistake, the DM faculty in ACE was not that good, but I forced myself to learn from him. Obviously it felt incomplete I had to learn from somebody else on youtube again, which wasted my precious time.  \n6. Test series are for practice, they do not directly reflect your result. Feel free to use your notes during initial days of your test series solving, it will build your confidence on your notes. But of course, stop using notes after a few tests, it will only hinder your speed and ability to memorize concepts.  \n7. (Not Shilling) Check out GateOverflow if you haven't already. It's just so valuable.\n\nThis is the best version of 'strategies' I could come up with. I know most of it is just basic knowledge, but sometimes you just need to hear it from someone else to actually work on it. So, good luck for your exams :)",

My little brother read through the solved Gate 2023 paper (ECE) the night before the examination and memorised the contour integration formula in complex analysis for the mathematics part of the Gate examination. That's it. So 1 formula (memorized hours before the examination) and 1 solved question paper (ECE, 2023), all this was done just one day before the Gate 2024 examination, he wrote both EE and ECE gate exams. Didn't join any coaching institute. That's it. And he secured an AIR under 200. He got direct admissions from IIT Bombay, Delhi, and Kanpur, without attending these interviews. Also got offer from IISc Bangalore (MTech in VLSI), for this he went to Bangalore to attend their interview. Thank you very much for sharing your journey with us. My brother also felt a little inferior. As he did almost nothing and still got an AIR under 200. He was just too shy to post all this. But after reading your post I thought about sharing his journey.",

Your ranks would have been much different, probably. It's possible. From what I heard, and from what I can see from your Ranks, it's much tougher to score in ECE than in AR. Only 9080 people wrote AR exam, which I think is one if the fewest, and AR is a relatively easier subject to score, that's what I can tell from your Ranks. Now imagine if 63000 people had written a relatively easier to score subject like AR. But fortunately for you only 9000 people wrote the exam not 63000.

What I'm saying is it can be relatively easier to score good ranks when the paper is relatively easier. Especially when relatively fewer people write it. Relatively is the key word here. Just think about state engineering entrance exams and all India engineering entrance exams. Most of people who score under 100 ranks in state engineering entrance, don't necessarily score that much in all India entrance exams. Ok, GATE is all India. But look only around 9000 people write AR exams, relatively much less. That's a fact. You just seem not to understand facts. Just imagine what would have happened if 63000 people had written a relatively easy to score exam like GATE AR. Even with around 9000 people writing the exam, you couldn't get AIR under 50, that too in a relatively easy Paper like AR. Just imagine what would've happened if 63000 people had written the AR exam.",

But I was quoting this year's numbers. Not when you wrote. You should've mentioned which year it was when you wrote it. It's clear who is getting pissed off bro 😂😂. It's clear to everyone except you 🤭🤭🤣. I have always supported my brother. He knows it. He needed me. And I supported him. Therefore, I can talk about his results. It's like a how a parent would. Ok? If my brother had written GATE AR Exam and even if he had scored AIR 1 in AR, I would have never mentioned it on this forum. Because people would just laugh at it 🤣🤣. Since you're having such a difficulty understanding basic things, let me tell you that I don't write about everything my brother achieves. Because  he managed to get MVLSI in IISc, one of the most sought degrees,  and he was having insecurities about it because preparation was not good. Let's say my brother got into IIT Roorkee in AR 😂, with or without preparation, do you seriously think that I would have written about it in Reddit or anywhere else? Do you seriously think that? Are you serious? Or something wrong with you. Do you think that I would've done that? Why would I do that? When clearly no one cares. Only around 9000 people write it 🤣, in India 😭. If 9000 students only from Lakshadweep wrote it, and my brother was of them, even then I wouldn't have mentioned it 🤣🤣. And we are talking about India. Bro, I have to apologize to you. Because in your first post, when you mentioned AR, actually I didn't know what it was 😭. I had to Google search, my bad 🤣😭. You see, that's how less people care about it. Look, if 63000 people had written your exam, they would've smashed you, and never in your life you would have written an exam without serious preparations 🤣🤣. Consider yourself lucky that only 9000 people wrote such a relatively simple exam 😂. And my brother has always appreciated my support. If I don't support my brother and write about him, who would? Clearly you don't have the sense to think through all this. So, kindly stop embarrassing yourself with a Rank you got In an Exam almost no one cares about 😭.",

Were you projects innovative or you copy pasted good projects and did some slight modifications, like most of the students?\n\nDid you consider pursuing ms from abroad? Given that the fees is humongous and the other financial aspects are daunting as well, is it worth according to you, for someone who wants to go into core and comes from a typical middle class family?\n\nDo you like core electronics or you are pursuing it for the sake of good package? Did you ever consider getting into IT/finance/consultancy field?

Now, this guy has always been our school topper and teacher's favorite. He always knew he'd do something in maths and has achieved his dreams. Only Way to go up.   \nI saw the environment there and Really understood why One needs to study among the best in the country. Now, I want to Experience the same and Study at an Institute of National Importance. But I also want to start earning. But I personally think I am not ready for the corporate world yet. \n\nShould I go all in for GATE26 or Try to have a backup in the form of placement ? \n\nTl;DR: Help OP take a descision for his future. Should he fullfill his dream of studying with Good Quality Students or Take and Average placement from his college and Build his life from there?",

Companies really value experience instead of just degrees.\n\n\n- doing an MTech will help you double your salary by getting placed in a good company at the start itself and you also get alumni status of a college. After a few years, the degree won't matter much to a business \n\n\n- Lets say you qualify gate, going to a reputed iit/nit is the best path forward \n\n\n-If you don't qualify also there are very good colleges that take people in. You wont believe how easy it is in some places to get a valid degree \n\n\n- Also important to note is that an MTech can help you go to teaching or do a PhD which are both great options in today's time \n\n\nMy suggestion for a safer, low risk life: \nJob -> MTech (after a while) -> job/teaching/phd\n\n\nThese are just ideas.

It's much harder to get a job without an experience, and doing an Mtech won't necessarily help too much if the job market keeps getting worse. With even a little bit of experience, it's much easier to get another job if you get laid off vs if you were a fresher. I was at your position about an year ago, even before getting a placement, I had a plan of working for an year and then getting into IIT Mtech, and I had gotten admissions too last year (in 3rd gen IITs, so not too great). Came to the conclusion that, since my focus was earning more and I didn't care much about \"Exposure at IIT\", it was best for me to continue working with the pay bumps I'm getting, which would net me at a similar place in terms of package if the job market continues to get worse. And besides, yes I missed the \"IIT exposure\", I am getting work exposure. So if earning money is your ultimate goal, either get into the top IITs where you'll actually get a sizeable pay bump, or gain work experience which you could use to switch to better jobs",

During that time, you can work with folks, talk with their students, etc etc and decide on whom to work with (I can tell about faculties at Bombay, but not in public).\n\nFor me my guide and co-guide's both are kinda chill, I would say they are very smart (fortunately they are like my role models now), flexible towards things, like let me work in my interests, let me collaborate with other folks eg: I use to work in Astronomy before with some foreign folks, than I started my remote intern at Google working on AI for Social Good, and now in summers I will be joining Adobe to work on LLM Alignment and no they are not the co-authors in any of these works",

If you want to do a master’s, go for an MS abroad. That’s the only thing that matters. MTech has no value.”\n\n(Though his comment annoyed me because I felt he should mind his own business, I replied politely.)\n\n**Me**: “If you pursue MTech from a random college, then yes, it might not be worth it. But if you crack the top IITs and choose a good branch, it can lead to a 30+ LPA package. It’s all about putting in the hard work.”\n\n**Him**: “But why not MS abroad?”\n\n**Me**: “An MS abroad is expensive and involves a lot of risks and competition. If you don’t land a job, the U.S. will send you back. Plus, the GRE is relatively easy also from India only, every year 10 lacs + people go for MS abroad. On the other hand, GATE is tough, and if you crack it, you’re already ahead of the curve. Many lives have changed after MTech. For example, my friend got AIR 28 in GATE and is now working at Microsoft in Seattle. There are plenty of such success stories.”\n\n**Him**: “Oh, that’s great, nice!”\n\n**Me**: “By the way, which company are you working for right now?”\n\n**Him**: “I work at Cognizant.”\n\n**Me** (internally): *End of discussion!*\n\n  \nI just want to say that guys, study as much as you can, cause in today's world, one who works hard, focuses on their work and minds their own business, is going to be successful.

        "body": "The truth is, most Indians are very dumb when it comes to having any sort of knowledge regarding graduate education such as Masters', MBA or PhD. The most important thing that people of this country don't understand is that a Masters' degree was originally designed to bridge the gap between a Bachelors' degree and a PhD so it's main objective is to enable students to perform and publish research on their own. If a Masters' degree doesn't have any research work associated with it, it's probably not worth pursuing it as most likely, it's a cash-grab programme designed to lure pathetically uninformed people like that guy you're talking about.\n\nMoreover, the job market abroad, especially in the US, is extremely unstable and no sane person including the ones who're studying at Ivy league institutions don't have very high expectations at this moment. A MS won't get you anything unless and until you're willing to work your ass off (harder than grinding for JEE) to merely bag a job, let alone a high paying one in this climate. The guy who told you that \"only MS is worth it\" will probably never get into top 100 universities in the US because those places require very good research work, CGPA, extraordinary GRE scores and a bunch of LORs from internationally recognized professors/professionals. I'm fairly certain that 5 years of experience at Cognizant isn't gonna be enough to get into places like GATech or CMU if he's got no research work and a bad academic record.\n\nAdditionally, Indians are simple-minded and only look at the global rankings when it comes to judging an university. An university that ranks high in QS doesn't necessary have a better CS/ECE programme than one which ranks lower, that's where subject rankings matter. Even after the subjects rankings, students need to research about what particular field of that subject is considered more prestigious and better where and why. This is why Yale engineers (Yale ranks 23rd in QS) make less yearly income than CMU engineers (CMU ranks 58th in QS).\n\nAt the end of the day, most Indians get into M. Tech/MS purely with the incentive of bagging a job while being absolutely disinterested about research/academics which is why our country barely has any AI patents when compared to US or China. Whether you give GATE or prepare for GRE, you need to have a learning attitude and must look beyond the degree. Top universities will give you the platform but you have to utilise it and learn something new and unique. If one's motive is to just grind leetcode in M. Tech/MS and have atrocious academic records with pathetic or no research, there's no point in pursuing further education.",

Unless and until you're getting into the top 1% of US institutions like Harvard or MIT, as an immigrant, your chances of landing a top job are **extremely** slim. The statement \"*as long as the odds are in your favor.*\" is redundant as the odds won't be in favour of Indian immigrant students right now the most due to the obviously tense political climate in the US. \n\nHalf of the MSCS programmes, even in prestigious places, are cash-grab programmes targeted at Indian students. ASU and USC for example, have terribly high batch strengths and would admit anybody given that they have obtained the cut-off CGPA. Most students graduating from these places struggle to find jobs and end up working at fast-food places. Unpopular universities that rank very low in the rankings aren't worth spending all that money since the ROI is minimal. I personally know some people who studied at places like that and are now unemployed. \n\nMoreover, getting citizenship in a foreign country, especially in the US as an Indian is extremely hard. Green card queues extend up to 150 years of waiting. As for layoffs, most US companies are outsourcing their developer teams to India for cheaper labour, the Americans keep complaining about Indians taking their jobs. And the H1B visa restrictions are criminal, if the company which helped you with the visa lays you off, you're doomed. Your argument isn't a well researched one and is based off of feelings rather than facts.",

He has created multiple whatsapp group in which he has added multiple topper students, along with whom R.Sharma tries solve doubts of the students at free of cost ,which is just kind of revolution for all of us in the GATE CSE Community. He also guides the student regarding which coaching institutes/teacher a student must follow for a particular subject, so don't the aspirat don't end up wasting his/her precious time on a insufficient content of a teacher. Even I've also seen that he has visited the result felicitation ceremony of many coaching institutes, and the reason for that he purchased the test series of all those institutions , in which I don't feel anything is wrong .

Reality ye hai ki kuch log khud se aage badhte nahi, aur dusro ko neecha dikhane me busy rehte hain.\n Rishi Sharma ke baare me ek baat clear hai – he has a hectic job schedule, fir bhi wo students ki help karne ke liye time nikalte hain. Tumhare queries, guidance, motivation — jitna possible ho, wo karte hain. Haan, ho sakta hai tumhara message turant reply na ho, but bhai ye samjho ki wo apna job chhod ke tumhare chats pe 24x7 nahi baithe hain. Iske baad bhi wo log help karte hain, jo bahut badi baat hai.\n\n\nMain personally bolunga – Rishi Sharma is genuinely a good human being. Helpful nature, supportive attitude, aur jis level ka unhone khud achieve kiya hai, utna imagine karna bhi sabke bas ki baat nahi hai.\n\n\nAb kuch coaching wale log bhi inse insecure hote hain. Ek coaching (naam nahi lunga) to literally top rankers ko linkedin pe khud approach karte  hai, din-bhar WhatsApp pe messages bhejte rehte the h. Main khud victim raha hu uska, itna spam kiya ki mujhe reply dena hi band karna pada. Rishi Sharma ne aisa kabhi nahi kiya, kyunki unka kaam sirf “show off” ya “business” nahi hai, balki genuinely students ki growth hai.\n\n\nMeri opinion simple hai – jitna Rishi Sharma ke baare me bolu, utna kam hai. Haters ke liye ek hi baat – beta pehle padhai pe focus kar, rank le aake dikha. Yahan sirf hate comments dalne se na ghar chalta hai, na career banta hai.\n\n\n Respect for Rishi Sharma – for his achievements, efforts, and supportive nature.\n\n\n- GATE 25 AIR-51",

Jo wo kiye Sab kuch khud se kiye, unke jaise hazaaro ka soch kr kiye. Agar itna aasaan hota free mein resources ek jagah laana, toh tum khud kyun nahi kiye? Par Rishi Bhaiya ne yeh kiye kyunki unhe samajh hai ki yeh kitna zaroori hai logon ke liye\n‎Aur yeh coaching institutes, Ek Telegram group ka link dete hain doubt resolution ke naam pe, jahaan doubts se zyada porn links milte hain. Kam se kam Rishi Bhaiya khud group check karte hain, meetings rakhte hain, apni journey share karte hain, not to show off, par to tell log that haan, mushkil hai, but possible hai, aur yeh raha strategy. \n‎One-on-one mentorship se itni problem hai? Toh bhai, khud shuru karo na Har ek ke liye roadmap banao, personalized routine do. Kya coaching waale yeh karte hain jo course ke 10-15 hazar lete hain? Wohi log jo paise dekar bhi kuch nahi paya, ab isko galat bol rahe hain. Kam se kam Rishi Bhaiya toh logon ko push kar rahe hain, Shayad baad mein fail bhi ho, par kaam toh karna seekh jayenge, unlike you keyboard warriors jo bas galiyaan dete ho. Zindagi kya gali dene se chalti hai?\n‎Aur yeh \"Sarkari Babu\" attitude waala taana? Bhai, kitne exams crack kiye hain tumne? Kitne interviews diye? Rishi Bhaiya ne 8-9 ghante ki job ke saath prep kiye, raat ke 3-4 baje tak jaag ke doosron ke doubts solve kiye. Aur kaun karta hai yeh? Haan, main tumhara soch nahi badal sakta, par baat yeh hai,tum paise bhi lo, tab bhi Rishi Bhaiya jaisa free mein help nahi kr paoge. ",

Regarding praising different teachers and coaching, Rishi has never kept it a secret that he has studied from multiple sources. Since, he prepared for a lot of exams and for a long time, it is obvious that he took help from various sources. What is the problem if he liked some coverage by someone and other parts by someone else?\n2. I am not Rishi, but the amount of messages I get for help can be sometimes overwhelming. Rishi is much more popular than me. I can only imagine the amounts of messages he must be getting. GATE syllabus must include economics as a subject so that you guys can understand the basics of it. You find it costly, dont take it. There are people taking it and it proves that its valuable.\n3. Promotes himself in groups? He has literally solved so many doubts there. Whats the problem if he shares a few of his linkedin posts there? Who doesnt want a little more fame? \n4. Regarding fragile ego, we havent seen the message b/w you guys, so cant say anything. How did you come to that conclusion?\n5. Do you have any proof that he got them banned? If yes, share here. Dont say that you have reasons to believe. I have reasons to believe you are Reddy’s student or he himself. But i didnt say that, did i?",

Criticism is one thing, but when it starts affecting people’s personal lives or spreading misinformation, it becomes a whole different matter.\n\nI’ve worked with \\[mentor\\] personally and seen the effort and time they put into helping others succeed. The dedication they’ve shown in terms of supporting students and sharing knowledge is something worth acknowledging. I get that some people have different views on certain approaches, but that doesn’t mean they should be disrespected or put down in public forums.\n\nAs for the claims and accusations going around, I think it’s crucial to be mindful of the impact we have when making statements, especially when those statements are based on assumptions or things that haven’t been verified. We should always aim to have conversations that are constructive and not driven by personal vendettas.\n\nLet’s keep it respectful, everyone. We’re all here to learn and grow, and it’s important to foster an environment that encourages that without dragging anyone down.\"",

Truth? It was 5–6 hours a day, 5 days a week.\n2. **Mock Tests**: I claimed to have attempted 25 full-length tests. Truth? Just 5 tests.\n3. **Course Completion**: I said I completed the entire syllabus. Truth? I don’t even know what EMFT is.\n4. **Preparation Time**: I told everyone it took me only 6 months to crack GATE. Truth? I was serious about my studies from day one of college.\n5. **Confidence in January**: I said I was confident about my preparation by January. Truth? I wasn’t even sure if I’d make it to the top 500.\n6. **Luck Factor**: I got 6 marks purely due to luck. Without those, I wouldn’t have made it to the top 100.\n7. **Post-GATE Life**: I believed life would be sorted after getting into a top college. Truth? I’ve never been more depressed than I am after getting placed.\n8. **Revisions**: I claimed to have revised all subjects 10 times. Truth? I revised only 5 subjects more than 3 times, skipped EMFT entirely, and was weak in communication.",

How did you figure what you wanted to do in your career? \n2. Can someone prepare for GATE EC in one year? \n3. My sole purpose to prepare for GATE would be to sit in placements from tier 1 colleges.

Should I opt for made easy? Their prices are very high but everyone says it's the best. Is it worth it?\n\nP.S- Also if you don't mind can you share why didn't you go for PSU? With under 50 rank would've easily secured good job there.",
