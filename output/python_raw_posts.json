I think it looks sleek and modern enough, and honestly its fantastic.\n\nHowever, as I love actual pythons (the animal), I couldnt help but notice that the snouts of the 2 pythons were quite beak-like... I think some have actually mentioned this but I personally think rounding off the snout (and maybe even the tails as well to keep symmetry!) would make the pythons more snake like. :)\n\nIt truly is amazing, and I think its time the logo got a change too!",

Tinder monitors your like to match ratio and filters your matches based on it.  If you swipe right on everyone and nobody swipes right on you, you'll be shown (and shown to) less attractive people (people with lower ratios themselves).  Until people eventually swipe right on you and your ratio goes up.  \n\nYou also get better matches if you have a higher response rate to your messages and if the person you're messaging uses specific keywords like their phone number.  The goal is to show you people of a similar attractiveness.  All dating sites do something similar.\n\nFor best results infrequently swipe (once or twice a week), message everyone who you match with, and always try to get their contact information.\n\nBut mass right swiping isn't a problem per se if they all match you back.",

Trying to figure out how to detect when my character has fired an arrow by just watching the screen, getting the health of a monster I was attacking and my own health, determining how much food I had left in my inventory to heal with, etc.  \n  \nI distinctly remember realizing that I could apply it to something other than RuneScape. I wrote some scripts to draw spirals and checkerboards in MS Paint. ",

The web server otherwise has no way of knowing whether or not a browser is controlled by selenium, or even if requests were sent to the server by a browser at all... The client is in *complete* control of what is sent to the server. Further, because client-side code is able to be examined, controlled, and altered by the client, server-side methods are almost exclusively used. In practice, actual active client-side deterrents beyond, say, Google ReCaptcha are rarely, if ever, implemented on the client-side.\n\nInstead, the most effective and commonly deployed detection methods (including methods used by ReCaptcha) are often heuristic in nature and look for bot-like behavior and activity from a server-side perspective, agnostic of what is actually controlling the behavior... And most sites don't even actively deter this. Automation experts merely need to make sure that communication with the server is indistinguishable from that of an ordinary client... which often doesn't even need a browser to begin with because the server doesn't care or know how it receives requests, only that they are well-formed and include the information expected.\n\nHaving done many projects in web automation, I can personally attest that there are very very very few cases where a tool like PyAutoGUI is the best choice for automating actions that take place in a browser.

My original comment was that for this specific case (making us all laugh), the code OP provided met all the requirements at minimal cost.\n\nThe problem with selenium is that when you're in a situation that requires that level of camouflage, the server will likely utilize another method to counter it. \n\nSelenium is a partial solution in an arms race. \n\nI have a project that uses selenium against a public data source (government data) but they're using tech from companies who advertise they can stop selenium scrapers. We do get around it, but we all know that it will continue to cost time and money to work around but ultimately this will be solved through  out-of-channel solutions (lawyer letters, friendly emails to build rapport, etc). \n\nGiven the arm's-race nature and the increased infrastructure costs selenium expects (system requirements are more than \"click here\") that's why I spoke against it.

I don't want to be put into the same box with nazis just because I have some cultural subconscious imprints that keep my body from a sexual reaction on dark skin and/or huge butts. The ultimate cause of this behavior might be considered \"racist\" and I was too if I deliberately decided not to be attracted by huge butts and/or black women. However, I cannot actively control what I find attractive and what I don't. Of course I can decide what I *think* about black women and huge butts on a totally different level that has got nothing to do with physical attraction. Thoughts and attraction might correlate but there's no direct connection between them. If we follow this path then feeling a stronger sexual attraction by a woman in a sexy outfit compared to a woman in a potato bag will be called \"sexist\". \n\nI think we need a word for cultural stifling and denial of inward emotional reactions (i.e. feelings) that we cannot control. \n\nOh, I might digress a little but isn't this racism, sexism, whateverism debate all about being triggered by some phrasing or behavior? Like, feeling to be personally attacked by something? I feel personally attacked by the racism debate because, like I said above, I don't want to be put into a box with nazis and true racists. I feel personally attacked by the sexism debate because I cannot deny the feelings that I have when I see an attractive woman (whatever \"attractive\" might mean). I can deliberately *act* upon them but I feel like my possibilities of acting are restricted further and further by calling everything \"sexist\" that in any way, shape or form points towards wanting to have sex with that woman. Even just making compliments today can lead to being accused of sexual harassment. Not saying that it happens in the majority of events but it's definitely a risk that I already start thinking twice about taking. Fortunately I am already married. Otherwise I'd have a tough time today finding a partner when finding a partner bears the risk of losing my mere existence to a witch hunt. Call me paranoid, but isn't that a core aspect of the whole debate that everyone should be able to express their way of living in a free and open manner without being harassed by others? I feel like the debate leads to a way of living freely by stifling the freedoms of others. Sure, I'm *not* asking for the freedom to grab a woman's ass in the wild. I'm asking for the freedom to - in a respectful manner - show her what I'm after so that after all is said and done she doesn't feel utilized and degraded because she knew from the very beginning where things were gonna end up. Isn't that a better way than pretending to want to get to know her in order to only get her into my bed? And how can the latter be considered sexist when it's something that men and women often want? Sometimes I don't want a full blown relationship but just have some fun. How's that sexist? \n\nAs I said, I digress... but that's what came to my mind thinking about the whole racism and sexism debates and I felt like getting this off my chest on this occasion. \n\nAnd now happy downvoting people! I'm used to getting kicked in the butt for not denying my personality. \n\n//edit: talking about bias: https://youtu.be/3WMuzhQXJoY",

And, make no mistake, your (by which I mean our, aka male) expressions of sexual feelings **do** threaten them with actual physical harm, in ways you might not be able to grasp without experiencing life from their point of view.\n\nWomen are trying to establish and defend their right to be free from being sexualized or objectified... that's a right (most) men enjoy from birth and therefore never even have to consider establishing or defending. They're not trying to police your thoughts, they're just trying to get you to police your actions based on those thoughts. And perhaps to consider having other, more productive, thoughts about them.\n\nIf you truly feel that women's rights activists are trying to police your actual brain, *ask them if that's true*, don't presume that it is.",

For example, researchers might use Python to explore results from a survey, create graphs, and fit mathematical models to understand trends over time.\n\nWe do exactly that in the book. There are two main datasets that we use throughout the book. One of them is the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/), an awesome social sciences project that has been administered for decades. We teach the reader how to write code to work with this data, and give examples of statistical analysis and models. We have a few references that could then be followed to learn more, or see other work that has been done by social scientists.\n\nHow was that answer? Can I clarify or explain anything further?",

There's one place in Chapter 5 where we interact with a Microsoft Access database file, but you can either skip that, try something like sqlite instead, or run Windows either as a dual boot or on a virtual machine.\n\nAlso a note: I was using Windows when we first started working on the book, but I've been using a Mac for about a year now.",

This will massively reduce the number of generations required for the model to converge because each generation will produce a larger increase in fitness and opens the door to parallelization.

Note that the first couple of circles will reduce the most amount of error.\n - It's possible to get stuck in some \"local\" minimum if the underlying loss space is bumpy. One helpful trick might be to increase randomness that can help escape local minimums and stumble upon a better nearby minimum, or even the global minimum itself.^1\n\n----\n\n^([1]: I don't know how exactly a n parameter loss space would extend to a n+1 parameter loss space, as you keep on increasing the number of parameters/circles all the way up till 256... so maybe this way of thinking doesn't make too much sense.)",

Best (fastest) cars in each generation are chosen to be parents of next slightly mutated generation. The NN has 2 hidden layers (5x4x4x2)\n* I will also train the NN on other tracks.\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\n[**GITHUB REPO**](https://github.com/aTom995/NeuralNetworkRacing)",

Simulating a particular case is easy enough, but that's not the same as solving the problem.\n\nIn the book, they use the human computer thing as a simulation to find what happens next, over the next X years or whatever. Obviously they get it wrong, but that's not the point here. The point is if they had computers then they'd easily be able to calculate future states for their system, since the start state is known. Finally that simulation would grow more and more inaccurate as time progresses, due to the fact that even a 3 body simulation is a prediction (it doesn't take into account other masses, such as asteroids / moons / other planets / etc...), and it's based on a measured start state, and that measurement will have an error.",

The three-body problem is a special case of the n-body problem. Unlike two-body problems, no closed-form solution exists for all sets of initial conditions, and numerical methods are generally required.\n\nHistorically, the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study was the one involving the Moon, the Earth, and the Sun.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

The shadows are opposite, so they don't follow the right behavior.  Topographical maps often have an artificial light coming from the \"north\" to help with that.  It makes it really confusing if you view it upside down.\n\nSimilarly, a light shined down on an indentation will shade the indentation in a way that's clear (shadow on the top, light on the bottom), but shine a light from the bottom and your perception of depth is changed.",

If I want to write those functions in VBA or vanilla Python, I know I can, but it'll take a while and still never compare to the speed and versatility that `pandas` has.\n\nHonestly why spend months building a car when you can just `pip install` one.

I wonder why I just got so little points and my teacher said it was because the code wasn\u2018t that tidy/neat. But in classes he never really mentioned that it was critical (for our program). \nSo my question is if it is valid that he takes so many points away only because it wasn\u2018t tidy enough even though I\u2018m of the opinion it\u2018s very clear what procedure is for what.

It is the set of ways to interact with a program or library.\n\nFor example a library such as mathplotlib here has many more functions that those described here,  most of them for its own internal use, they wouldn't be useful to a user. In that case the API is the functions that are documented for the user and that the user is expected to use directly in order to interact with the library.\n\nAnother common example is web API: a set of URLs that allow you to programmatically interract with a website. Most websites are designed primarily for humans, so it can be hard for programs to access information when it is formated for bipedes. So some websites propose an API, generally a set of URLs that allow programs to interract with the website.\n\nFor example [here is the documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/albums/) of spotify's API that allows you to search albums, artists, access your playlists etc from a program. This is very useful to create new clients or bots.",

        "body": "Welcome and hello! You were right to wonder if this is the right place to ask - the Reddit Python community created a separate subreddit, r/learnpython to provide a platform so folks like you can ask questions and so that folks who want to help can find those needing help.\n\nThat said, I understand your confusion in the above situation because it sounds like your teacher was either unsuccessful in communicating their expectations or evaluated your work to a different standard than you expected.  I think it's fair to say that, in the Python community especially, readability is one of the most important values in coding.  The emphasis on readability is one of the things that sets Python apart technically and culturally from other languages and other language communities. The reason its important is that while compiled machine code contains instructions for the computer, high level code will primarily be read by other people, including yourself at a later date. If code can be easily understood, it is easier to ensure that it is correct, its easier for others to understand (almost self-documenting), it can be more easily maintained, and more easily extended.  Because all of these human activities are often more costly than the machine activity of running code, it is a trend in modern languages to prioritize the developer's time by optimizing for readability.  This principle is also captured in the first few lines of the zen of python. Here's an article called [\"Meditations on the Zen of Python\"](https://orbifold.xyz/zen-of-python.html) that discusses it.  \n\n\nI know I took your comment about tidyness or neatness and responded with a discussion of code readability or beauty, but I think the ideas are linked. I believe that tidiness is one of the qualities of beautiful code and that one of the primary benefits of beautiful code is readability. Putting a standard on beauty is certainly difficult because it is subjective. There are numerous python style guides including the original/official one, [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), and auto-formatters like the currently popular [black](https://github.com/psf/black). Code formatting and style are just the beginning of tidiness or beauty, as Raymond Hettinger demonstrates beautifully in his classic talk, [Beyond PEP8 -- Best practices for beautiful intelligible code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M).",

This produced self-emerging oscillations in pupil size, reminiscent of dynamical systems oscillators (loop cycles).\n\nIn the supplementary material, I describe how I calculate the pupil size based on a mathematical model of the eye as a sphere.\n\nFeel free to write me if you have any more questions.

I think that on Windows scripting in general is pretty terrible. You have the old WSH engines for VB and JScript (!= Javascript) that are barely looked at and more like in maintenance mode since a decade, and otherwise Powershell scripting with an obnoxious Powershell-only syntax and [unorthodox return semantics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10286164/function-return-value-in-powershell). Why oh why they never simply did a [CS-Script](http://csscript.net/) with maybe syntax sugar extensions for command line oriented features like piping and command line parsing, usage help, rather than the Powershell language is beyond me. C# since it got [DLR enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview) is pretty convenient to use for short snippets of script code anyway, and Roslyn makes C# [scripting enabled](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Scripting-API-Samples).",

Programming is different because Python is not just a language spec but an ecosystem in which the lowest user is reliant on other open source developers for the service of providing useful libraries. There exists a vast ecosystem of Python 2 libraries and a vast ecosystem of Python 3 libraries, and only a very limited number of open source developers to keep the whole thing maintained and useful.  If people paid for the privilege of using Python 2 or 3 then it wouldn't matter.

The value I've found in it is in its simplicity for the non-programmer.\n\nI worked with a large team of super talented CAD guys and engineers, who all knew Excel and Access and their various CAD seats (ProE, Catia, whatever-thefuck, I'm not a CAD guy)... but they didn't know programming at all outside CNC and a bit of PLC stuff.\n\nBut when I introduced them to VBA with a large estimating / program management spreadsheet set we were developing, they took off like fish in water.  Highly technical guys with a ton of knowledge, but sort of... trapped... in their various platforms.  VBA just like, set them free.  They started thinking differently.  In weeks those dudes were performing small miracles with data sets and automation, and many of them jumped right off into other languages like Python, Perl, and even into c++, extending not only our project, but building modules for their CAD systems and cool stuff on the floor machine side.  It was really cool to watch.\n\nSo yeah, *way* better than nothing.  ",

        "body": "Yeah we took a single C++ course on actual programming principles in first year and then after that the only people learning proper programming techniques were the computer engineers. In my degree program we used matlab for some signal processing and very primitive numerical methods, but other than that it was all using either commercial tools for modelling or using excel and matlab to analyze data.\n\nI didn't start really learning the fundamentals of computational numerical analysis until grad school, and even at this point basically everything I know about programming principles and standards is either self taught or was learned from working with senior graduate students in projects.\n\nIt's fair though.. An engineering degree is seeking to teach you very specific things about fundamental physics, the design process, and the process and execution of modeling from a conceptual standpoint. I'm totally fine with having to learn the specific execution of various models myself. I just wish there had perhaps been an option in my coursework where either some analysis courses could have encouraged students to use lower level languages to write their own efficient codes for analysis, or at least an offered course that would focus on proper standards and practices when using C++ for numerical modelling. I'm also kind of upset with myself for leaning on the crutch of excel and matlab for so long and putting off learning how to use Python and C++ until I had to. It made the quality of my work in the past less than it could have been (both in terms of efficiency and results), and I feel kind of on my back foot now in terms of my level of understanding of and skill with lower level languages.\n\n\nI will say though, learning matlab is not a waste. It's a very powerful language if you just want to quickly prototype an analysis method. The syntax makes scripting very quick and straight forward, the debugging tools are excellent, and the visualization suite is second to none - I work in fluid mechanics research and matlab is what I use to generate all of my data visualizations for my publications, reports, and presentations (even if my analysis is done on another platform I'll export the data to a format matlab can import for plotting or making more animations). You can do a lot of good stuff with matlab. The problem is (1) it's less efficient than lower level languages so you really can't use it for cutting edge CFD for example, and (2) it's kind of expensive as just an analysis tool so you can't just know matlab and no other languages or else you'll be useless at most engineering companies.

I'm using openfoam over Fluent (or any other commercial code) because I'm doing a lot of solver modification (for assimilation of experimental data into the simulations), and I need direct access to the source code of the solvers. Moving forward I think I will be switching over to self-written codes, or just simpler open-source libraries, in C++, because it's getting to the point where the modifications I want to make are so fundamental that it would probably be more work to modify openFoam to do what I want than to just write it myself from the ground up.\n\nI'm in somewhat of a unique position research-job-wise. I had an above-average level of success in my MSc research, so for my PhD I have government funding that comes with limited-to-no oversight (I didn't publish once last year and no-one cared), and I have a research advisor that believes in me and isn't really all up in my business all that much. So there's very little stress and/or pressure on me other than what I impose on myself via my own expectations.. I meet with a few grad students once a week where we all discuss our progress, and I meet my advisor once every other week, and at these meetings if we don't have a lot to talk about or not a lot got done in the last week or two its not a big deal... you have dry spells where not a lot happens when you're developing modeling and/or analysis techniques, it's the nature of development. I'm also just not really worrying about what the job situation will be after I graduate. Obviously there is like a 1% chance I get a job that is actually related to my research, but a PhD in engineering opens up a lot of job opportunities.

For ease, they right click on the audio icon in the bottom right (windows) and quickly mute all the applications except Zoom to make sure some alert notification or whatever doesn't end up recorded. They then set audacity to record their computer's audio, only to find Spotify un-mutes itself after an ad finishes half way through the call. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying this is a common occurence, but bugs rarely are.",

I've looked into conda and all but it takes some energy to find the good ressources that will help when you've never used anything else than Matlab which just works out of the box. (Any awesome tutorial to give good practices as to the management of a project in and around the code? i.e. \"I'm going to start a project xyz, what's a good practice to manage my code and dependencies in a not cluttery way so that I can start working on the code and not fighting bugs?\")\n\nBut in the long run I hope to rely more and more on Python than on Matlab!\n\nTL;DR : I'm a Matlab user that wants to avoid the mistakes you do at the beginning when learning Python",

R is probably closer to Matlab.

Not all programming is a DefaultGeneralNullPointerExceptionFactory.\n\nMatlab has an domain-intuitive design. OP shits on the fact that Mathworks mentions the extra brackets and numpy imports required to type when it in fact increases legibility of numerical code significantly (besides coming from a language which uses whitespace for indentation to increase its own legibility instead of brackets). \n\nYes, of course, one may question that it's proprietary and damn expensive, but to question whether it's users are programmers and claim superiority of python when only a fraction of its users work in the same domain, that's elitist, and hardly fitting the design goal of python and programming in general.",

This is from their website right now\nhttps://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/adalm-pluto-radio.html\n\nMy needs were to design my own wifi signals with parameters in the headers I configured preferably with automation.  \n\nI requested a license for Matlab since nobody on my team has it we got a trial license for 90 days. I spoke to the rep on the phone and through email and he assured it was all very straightforward. Turns out he was complexly wrong. The rep simply sent us a trial Matlab license without the Pluto communications toolbox plugin. Without this plugin Matlab doesn't even recognize the Pluto sdr. So I request another trial license for the plugin. Install that and I take a look at their examples on how to use their language to generate wave forms,  NONE of them work! I can't tell what's going on in the language the syntax sort of looks like C but looks like Scheme sometimes.  Anyway hard for me to debug if some of the working code looks odd to me. Tic Toc was written by a person I never want to meet.\n\nI ended up watching a YouTube video with an instructor for Matlab that was very helpful except none of the examples he is referring to in his presentation I had access to. I called Matlab and requested the examples and cited the instructor's name. They sent me the examples files and again most of them are broken as in don't actually work or error out. So I scheduled 3 conference calls, in the last one it involed the Matlab engineer debugging their own examples, apparently nobody ever tested with the Pluto device, many of the core libraries didn't recognize my device name, so I had no apis calls that had any effect. Toward the end of the project I discovered another completely different way to generate wave forms using an elaborate Matlab gui instead of using their silly ass programming language, as long as I had the raw I/Q data I didn't care it came from so we don't even mess with the language much anymore since our needs are so specific.\n\nPython as far as I know didn't have anything working for the Analog device Pluto SDR so I have no choice. If there is one out there, please share it with me.",

Spyder, like one of the other commenters have said is recommended as it has a sort of similar interface to MATLAB and is built for scientific coding. Once you know Python well enough, you can consider using text editors like Visual studio code which is more lightweight and looks nicer which helps you code better imo. \n\nMATLAB lets you run MATLAB scripts via python so you can exploit that for your work flow although I wouldn't rely on this too much as its quite slow if you don't have an SSD as it calls the entire MATLAB engine. Nevertheless it's possible. Additionally from a brief Google search I just did now, you can convert your MATLAB code to python. \n\nAs an anecdote, the reason why I moved to Python was because MATLABs interface was too clunky and the colour scheme was horrible. The green comment colour is difficult to see against a white background, there's no dark mode and you can't adjust the window size. \n\nAt the moment I'm using Atom, a text editor and I'm able to change my theme according to how I like it, I'm able to commit to github easily, I have a folder tree on my left that I can hide at will, I have a mini map of code on my right so I can see which bits of code I need to go to and I have a spell checker and linter to check through my code.

In my case, I went with anaconda as it gives me everything I need. I use a conda environment for each individual project, and use conda to save the dependencies of that environment with one command. Also check out \"cookie cutter\" on github. It's a python code that you can use to make your projects organized. I love it.\n\nFinally, as others have stated, spyder really made the switch easier. The big plus is the python console for quick code checks and the variable explorer for seeing your data just like in Matlab.\n\nSo, in summary:\n1) Anaconda (or miniconda) with conda environments to control your packages\n\n2) cookie cutter to create organized project directories \n\n3) spyder to write and test code\n\nBonus: I use jupyter notebook to do the data exploration using the code I write in spyder. Let's say I do an experiment, now I can make all my graphs in one jupyter notebook and do my analysis there. I can easily change the graphs on the fly. It's like PowerPoint for viewing graphs mixed with Matlab for changing graphs quickly. Definitely recommend. \n\n\nLet me know if you need help.\n\nEdit: just to be clear. When using anaconda, you don't need things like pip and pyenv. It does those for you.",

Doing write-ups on jupyter is bar none an excellent way to show off your work.  \n[Here is an example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/3_NeuralNetworks/convolutional_network.ipynb) of how something you write up may work. It also supports markdowns with Latex syntax, so you can make your findings even more pretty. adding a library is as simple as opening up a terminal and typing\n```\npip3 install **some library**\n```\n\nDebugging:  \nLets say you want a file of functions. Call it func.py. Now on func.py you import numpy (for the love of god learn numpy) for any numpy funcs. You write each function with inputs and outputs. Save it. \nOn your main project, say the jjupyter file, you can simply say  \n```\nfrom func import *\n```\n\n(there is more syntax to this but it is basically that easy)\n\nNow say you type in a problem and it is giving unexpected results, and you think it may be a problem in one of the functions.  \n\nI am not sure how much time you have to learn things, but in this case I really, really recommend Pycharm. You can set up your whole environment on there. (A lot of people recommend anaconda, but for specific environments I have encountered issues). Debugging is as simple as setting a marker and pushing 'run', then stepping through to find the bug. That takes time to learn but it is insanely helpful once you understand how to use it. \n\nAnyway Matlab has better 3d plotting than python, but overall python has a hell of a lot more libraries and open source tools to use.

To borrow your analogy, it\u2019s as though Microsoft were putting out promotional material showing all the newsletters and magazines people have laid out using Excel.\n\n> The second problem is that if you think of yourself as \u201cnot a programmer,\u201d that actually doesn\u2019t stop you from needing to write code. It might stop you from seeing that you need to write code. Which is a condition that infests a whole lot of people.\n\n> Your pitch here is really\u2026 strange. It reminds me of the curious phenomenon where textbooks pitched at college freshman are titled \u201cX for Scientists and Engineers\u201d and books with actual meat on their bones are more often titled \u201cIntroduction to X.\u201d I mean here you come out purporting to be in defense of scientists and the only things you say about them are incredibly belittling! (I wonder if there is some personal insecurity and projection fueling this.) I think you are doing a disservice to scientists and engineers by both belittling their computational needs, and inflating the perceived difficulty of anything that might actually meet their needs.\n\n<snip>\n\n> Matlab has an domain-intuitive design. \n\nNo, it really doesn't. Does your stats textbook use left-stochastic matrices? (You *could* use a right-stochastic matrix, except the performance hit is too severe for sparse matrices. Seriously.) Does any other numerical system you've encountered default to 16 bit arithmetic? Oh, here's a good one: what's your *intuition* for what the output of vpa(2305843009213693951) is?\n\nYou only think it's domain-intuitive because that's all you've ever used. But there are dozens of computing tools written for this domain that you have never used, so out of ignorance you think Matlab is somehow competitive. Which it definitely is not. These days, the best ones are even free! \n\nIt isn't elitist to say that Matlab is one of the worst possible tools for any given job. It's the opposite of elitist. It's democratizing. Pick nearly any other tool in the domain space and chances are it's better than Matlab. Have you ever used Julia? Python? R? Oh, I see you like to spend a lot of money. Have you tried Mathematica? At least if you used C++ or Rust you could write a descent data structure, manage memory, have predictable performance characteristics, and be able to hire cheap programming talent on UpWork whenever you wanted. But no, let's pretend that even if they were the only alternative the learning curve for those systems programming languages are so fucking steep that spending months or even years trying to work around Matlab's *unique* limitations is somehow worth it. Let's pretend that the licensing costs\u2014before the costs of all of the toolboxes that provide the most basic functionality not included in Matlab proper that you need to do anything useful\u2014aren't more than it would costs to hire an undergraduate to write all your code for you. It's a different pot of money, I suppose, so let's choose the worst, most expensive piece of shit software possible because we can't be bothered to learn anything else besides what we used in grad school.

I'm not saying that's an invalid design decision, but it doesn't really make sense to spring on the intended audience: physicists/engineers/etc who don't really have a programming background but need to be able to code some simulations. That crowd is often going to want to basically just type in the equations in their textbooks (hence reserving both i and j for the imaginary unit\u2014in electrical contexts, i is current, so they use j for the imaginary unit), which will often result in looping over ijk indices since those are what textbooks usually use for 3D vectors/matrices. That crowd will also typically not have the background to realize the potential problem here.\n\nI found out about this via someone on reddit saying that they spent an entire summer pulling their hair out trying to figure out why their complex equation was returning a pure real result and finally figured out it was because he'd used i as a loop variable and instead of being reset to sqrt(-1), it was staying as the last value it hit while iterating through the loop. If they want to keep the behavior they should really at least print a warning about what you're doing to the console.",

For example, I never saw any naming conventions or comments conventions in MATLAB docs, so I am just using Javascript naming conventions and Python comments.\n\nIn compiled programming languages, conventions are important for team work and for compilation. You need to have a `main` in Java, C, or in C++. In Python, we have PEP8 and the Zen of Python that tells us how to properly write code. But MATLAB doesn't have nothing.\n\nAnother good example was a post I saw on Quora where someone from a company said they had hired students that just graduated from their bachelor degree. These students knew only MATLAB, so the first thing they didi with them was to make them learn Python and Numpy. Their primary reason was so they learn how to write a good code.",

And those people learned it one way and are very resistant to change, they would be pissed off if the syntax was changed (say, for the better, not that they would know).

Also if you're doing a calculation for a paper. Or checking quickly if you're on the right track when solving some problem.\n\nIf you need to make a GUI program that does something you use MATLAB for in the background, you have several options.\n\nYou could write the GUI code in something decent like Qt (C++) or PyQt (Python) and then redo the math in the same language. You can use Eigen for matrix operations in C++, and of course NumPy in Python.\n\nThe second way would be to write the GUI code in Qt or something similar, write the math in MATLAB, generate C code (apparently you can generate C++, too) from MATLAB and compile and link them together.\n\nThese options are actual software development and require real programming knowledge.\n\nOf course, there is the third option we all know about: making your GUI house of cards in MATLAB.\n\nI prefer the first option. Numpy's syntax isn't bad enough for me to forgo other benefits Python brings to the table. Actually, I don't mind it at all. So I just write all of it in Python and it's decent software, can be unit tested easily, integrates properly with the OS and other software. Qt and PyQt make it look native, you can easily make parts of the gui drag-and-drop, you can interface with databases easily, issue HTTP requests, interface with devices over serial, etc.\n\nHowever, you may find Numpy to be a bit slow in some cases. Specifically, sometimes you have to be sure that the calculation you're doing is optimally paralellized to be efficient enough. This is where you'd use C++ and Eigen, and you may as well do the GUI in Qt in C++. There is always an option to create Python bindings for everything if you want to and use Python for GUI.\n\nMATLAB code generation options look okay (never used them, though), but why would you pay for them when there are open source alternatives? MATLAB being closed source means you're at their mercy when you have a problem, you may be in a situation where the offending code is in MATLAB's black box. Or some functionality may be removed or broken in an update. I just don't see the point.\n\nAnd, at the end, a bit of hyperbole: I'd rather do vector math in JS than GUI or data processing in MATLAB.",

        "body": "> I like how disagreeing with people here automatically makes you an \"ignorant\" shill of the evil MathWorks corporation.\n\nNo, NO. Stop right there, buckaroo. Just stop. I am unequivocally NOT saying that \"disagreeing with people makes you an 'ignorant' shill of the evil MathWorks corporation.\" I very much doubt you have any connection to MathWorks whatsoever. And I don't think twice about MathWorks as a corporation. I think they are trying to make as much money as they can get away with, and succeeding brilliantly. I happen to think they have a really shitty product that has literally set science back *decades*, but that's not their fault in the least. They are doing what a company is supposed to do: make money. It's the fault of the academics too lazy to spend the intellectual capital to investigate the available tools, full stop. *Literally no one here has called you a shill.*\n\nAnd you might be a brilliant fucking scientist. I don't have a clue. You might be the world's greatest neuroscientist or whatever. Pick your favorite hotshot subject, it doesn't matter. I'm not calling you an ignorant *person*. My claim is far, far more narrow. My claim is that you are obviously ignorant of the numerical software and computer algebra landscape. \n\nNow here's the thing: If someone comes along and tells you, \"Everyone knows the world is 6,000 years old. LOADS of biologists think so!,\" what is the appropriate response? Because, however one would like to think otherwise, as hard as it is to believe, there unequivocally ARE working biologists who do believe the world is 6,000 years old. I have personally met several, believe it or not. (I grew up in an interesting religious community.) But anyone working in the life sciences would absolutely be justified in characterizing someone who claims that the earth is 6,000 years old as ignorant with respect to earth and life sciences. They might be among the best brain surgeons in the world (like Ben Carson, a walking paradox) or a brilliant mathematician, but the simple fact remains that even a scientifically literate non-scientist should be able to think of at dozen independent scientific reasons that a 6,000 year old earth is untenable without a moment's notice. And those who know better, especially those who actually do work as scientists in the earth and life sciences, look upon the young-earth creationist, regardless of their self confidence, as someone who just doesn't know that much about the relevant subjects. A young-earth creationist is simply ignorant, and that's a brute fact despite their very different perception of themselves.\n\nNow here you are, perhaps an incredibly competent working scientists, extolling the virtues of Matlab in the numerical computing space. Along come a crowd of computer scientists and mathematicians telling you Matlab is shit, and your reaction is to say that loads of people with experience in other languages find Matlab useful and worthwhile. A couple of things: first, the claim isn't that Matlab is 100% useless. (See below.) Rather, the claim is that it's a shit programming language (absolutely true) that is the wrong tool for almost every job. I know those two things sound the same, but they're not. Believe it or not, there *are* some things for which Matlab is currently the best tool. But almost none of the things it is actually used for fit that category. That's an important but subtle difference. Second\u2014and this is the most important part of my screed\u2014the claim is that virtually no one who has any meaningful experience in programming languages thinks Matlab is anything but a piece of shit programming language, *even if it has its uses.* Now, to be fair, yes, I did slip in an extra weasel word I have previously been leaving out: *virtually* no one with any meaningful experience in programming languages... I'll concede that the word virtually is new here.\n\nI happen to have had an interesting academic career that has put me in contact with a lot of different kinds of scientists: an undergrad career in computer science, a stint in software engineering in industry before getting a PhD in pure math, circled back around to cs via computer algebra programming languages, and now collaborate with life scientists. I only tell you that in order to say this: while I have met several biologists who are also young earth/life creationists, I have not met anyone, whether in industry or academia, who has any meaningful experience in multiple programming languages and has used Matlab enough to form a judgment who doesn't think Matlab is a steaming pile of shit. Yes, I suppose this *is* anecdotal, but in my entire career, I have found that among those who are in any position whatsoever to make a judgment, biologist young earth/life creationists are much more common than programming language people who like Matlab.\n\nIf you've read this far, then frankly you have more patience than I do. At this point our conversation is an instance of, \"My dad can beat up your dad\": Neither one of us has anywhere to go. But I want to at least leave you with a concession: Admittedly this isn't my area of expertise, but *to my knowledge* there really isn't an adequate alternative to SimuLink and Control System Toolbox. I'll give Matlab those. And as much as I shit on Matlab\u2014which is a lot\u2014I really don't mind if someone is more productive in Matlab in their day-to-day computation work and chooses to work with it. Who gives a shit if they get their stuff done? The problem only arises when Matlab becomes a Golden Hammer, when it's used for a project without any thought whatsoever about what alternative tools exist that might be better for the task. It's that inability\u2014or worse, unwillingness\u2014to consider learning something new that is a cancer on the scientific enterprise. And that's not a problem with Matlab, it's a problem with *scientists.*",

If you ever find out exactly when they switched from 16 bits to... looks like 64 bits, I'd love to know. It must have been REALLY RECENTLY, though, because *[their documentation still says explicitly that Matlab uses 16 bit arithmetic by default](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/digits.html#bt8wnpt-4).* It must have been in the last six years or so at the latest. Which means that this superior *numerical* CAS of yours stayed on 16 bit arithmetic, with an allegedly \"intuitive\" suite of **16 bit numerical toolboxes (?!?!)**, for literally decades after the entire world had moved to at least 32 bits.

Here's math.js, copied and pasted from docs:\n\n    // create an array and a matrix\n    const array = [[2, 0], [-1, 3]]               // Array\n    const matrix = math.matrix([[7, 1], [-2, 3]]) // Matrix\n    \n    // perform a calculation on an array and matrix\n    math.square(array)                            // Array,  [[4, 0], [1, 9]]\n    math.square(matrix)                           // Matrix, [[49, 1], [4, 9]]\n    \n    // perform calculations with mixed array and matrix input\n    math.add(array, matrix)                       // Matrix, [[9, 1], [-3, 6]]\n    math.multiply(array, matrix)                  // Matrix, [[14, 2], [-13, 8]]\n\nIt's even *easier* with C++:\n\n    #include <iostream>\n    #include <Eigen/Dense>\n    // Create a 2x2 matrix called a.\n    Matrix2d a;\n    a << 1, 2,\n         3, 4;\n    // Create a 2x2 matrix called b using an alternative but just as easy syntax.\n    MatrixXd b(2,2);\n    b << 2, 3,\n         1, 4;\n    //Their sum\n    a + b;\n    //Their difference.\n    a - b;\n    // Increment a by amount b.\n    a += b;\n    \n    // Make some 3d vectors.\n    Vector3d v(1,2,3);\n    Vector3d w(1,0,0);\n    // Mother fucking scalar product.\n    w - 2*v;\n    // Vector product. BAM!\n    w*v;\n\nIt's almost like you've never even fucking *seen* vectorized calculations done in C++. \n\nAnd I'm not even sure if you are using that word right. MathWorks sure as hell doesn't. You see, in the world of numerical computing, vectorization means using processor instructions (sometimes called SIMD instructions) that are designed to work on multiple data elements at the same time, whereas in the land of Matlab it means not using a for loop. Which, to be fair, is good advice in most languages, but especially in Matlab where interpreted code is apparently transcribed by a hamster before execution on an abacus. \n\nThe Eigen C++ code above automatically uses SIMD instructions. In fact, it automatically uses the most powerful SIMD instructions on the many different hardware platforms it supports. \n\nMeanwhile, Matlab... *might* use SIMD instructions *maybe*? depending on the computation you're doing. And despite being a CAS specifically focused on linear algebra, Matlab only gained this ability in, like, 2011. I kid you not. And it only got it then because it adopted MKL. Which means, for those keeping track at home, that only those operations for which Matlab uses MKL (plus FFT, apparently) use SIMD. How... cutting edge.",

Java's swing lib has eclipse and visual studio works with C++ and vb.net and C# (windows only), but python is straight coding which is a pain in the ass and slower to prototype even if the language is easier to write.\n\nLastly, python isnt compiled which means C++ will outperform it by a mile, especially for gui dev.\n\nI love python but I dont deny its shortcomings.

Try doing simple vectorized calculations from MATLAB but in C++ and get back to me on that. And JavaScript? Come on man lol.\"\n\nYou see, the *point* is that, despite your claim to the contrary, doing \"simple vectorized calculations\" in C++ and JavaScript is trivially easy, extremely readable, and at least in the case of C++, much more performant, not to mention free. To spell it out for you, the point is, you have obviously never *tried* to do \"vectorized\" computations in anything other than Matlab. Which gives weight to the argument that the only reason you think Matlab is any good at the things you think it's good at because you are ignorant of the alternatives. I don't know whether or not that's true. Maybe you aren't. But damn, those examples really make a strong case.\n\n> No one in research uses C++ as an alternative for MATLAB for a ton of reasons, one being that you have to compile it. This should be obvious to you.\n\nObviously many scientists don't use C++ for their research. My reading of the anti-Matlab crowd is, that's exactly the whole complaint, that is, that scientists make really bad decisions about which software to use. In my experience, scientists are *the worst* at using the wrong tool for the job, which the widespread use of Matlab testifies to. They just use whatever their advisor tells them to use, because they don't know any better. So you end up with this mish-mash spaghetti code in Matlab that took some poor graduate student 9 months to code when they could have learned how to do it in Python from scratch in a week with a simple \"import sklearn\" or whatever. Hey, I don't know you, so I don't know if that's you or not, but I mean, your comments aren't painting a picture of a scientist whose very well-informed with respect to the available software tools in the numerical computing space. (Scientists don't use C++ because it has to be compiled?! Really?!)\n\nOf course, tons of scientists  *do* use C++ and Python for their research. Maybe in your field the only thing people use is Matlab, and so \"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" But if you branch out a bit, you'll find a ton of statisticians, data scientists, and ecologists using R, HPC people using C++, mathematicians using Python, Pari, and Mathematica, physicists using a lot of C/C++ and Mathematica, etc. From my point of view, scientists in other fields have the same problem of not using the right tool for the job. For example, I think R is the Matlab of ecology. Nothing against R, but it has its strengths and weaknesses, and it just shouldn't be used for everything under the sun.

Because you literally said, and I'm going to quote you here, \"Try doing simple vectorized calculations from MATLAB but in C++ and get back to me on that. And JavaScript? Come on man lol.\" And so I did simple vectorized calculations from Matlab but in C++ and then got back to you, you know, like you said. Except they the operations were actually vectorized in C++, whereas Matlab uses serial operations for matrix addition and subtraction. So where is the confusion here? Maybe here:\n\n> in C++ **using an external library.**\n\nOh, so it really just sounds like you're confused because you don't know how software works. Eigen is a C++ library. To do matrix/vector math in C++, you use a C++ library like Eigen, which, if I may reiterate, is written in C++. I wonder, do you know how Matlab does it's matrix arithmetic? For some of its operations, it uses Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKS), and MKS is in turn written in C/C++ and Fortran (and probably a little assembly language). Now I'm wondering what you think \"external library\" means.\n\nThe only part of Matlab that is actually optimized for modern processors is the part that uses MKS, because MKS is optimized for modern processors using SIMD. \n\nThis is basically where I realize you don't know how computers work. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just an unusual feature of someone who is arguing the superiority of one computer programming language over another.\n\n> I mean you claimed MATLAB was worse at managing memory than C++ which is nonsensical. C++ is slowly dying specifically because it doesn\u2019t manage memory\n\nAt this point I am starting to doubt that you have ever used Matlab, much less C++.

There is no debate here. \n\n>\tTo spell it out for you, the point is, you have obviously never tried to do \u201cvectorized\u201d computations in anything other than Matlab.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.

I don't need to dig up any of your stuff because you're already coming across as a hilariously arrogrant blowhard who doesn't actually know anything.\n\n>Oh, so it really just sounds like you're confused because you don't know how software works. Eigen is a C++ library. To do matrix/vector math in C++, you use a C++ library like Eigen, which, if I may reiterate, is written in C++. I wonder, do you know how Matlab does it's matrix arithmetic? For some of its operations, it uses Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKS), and MKS is in turn written in C/C++ and Fortran (and probably a little assembly language). Now I'm wondering what you think \"external library\" means.\n\nYes, and the point is that you have to download it, install it, and link against. In MATLAB, it's all there already. Hence, it is easier to use and less ugly. This isn't complicated. Please, bring up the MKL (or as you call it, MKS) again. That's really helping you so much. \n\n>\tThis is basically where I realize you don't know how computers work.\n\nYou originally said MATLAB was an ugly language compared to C++, and I said it wasn't. Now you're talking about SIMD and instruction sets for some reason and being patronizing about it which is funny. It isn't complicated stuff man. You don't actually know what MATLAB is doing in this respect because it's all proprietary. There is an entire Parallel Computing Toolbox for MATLAB which I'm sure you're an expert in. https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html\n\n>At this point I am starting to doubt that you have ever used Matlab, much less C++.\n\nlol okay man. You definitely aren't projecting. I'll repeat the example I used in another reply to show how much better MATLAB is at these types of calculations:\n\ntry and create a diagonal matrix with the values being the square roots of 1 2 3 and print it out \n\nIn C++ with eigen:\n\n    #include <iostream>\n    #include \"Eigen/Dense\"\n    int main()\n    {\n        Eigen::Matrix< double, 3, 1> v ;\n        v << 1, 2, 3;\n        Eigen::Matrix< double, 3, 3> m = v.array().sqrt().matrix().asDiagonal());\n\n        std::cout << m << \"\\n\";\n    \n        return 0;\n    }\n\nThe equivalent in MATLAB:\n\n`m = sqrt(Diag([1 2 3]))`\n\nOh shit, look at that?

Be able to work in less than a year?  I will take the PhD in Computer Science advice who is the creator of Finxter.",

        "body": "#### Fight me on this. Long rant.\n\nNot everybody has the capacity or the need to learn programming.\n\nDon't force people, Don't guilt them into it, heck Don't even entertain people when they say \"Oh I want to learn programming, but I don't where to start\". Just say \"Google it\".\n\nEveryone knows where to look if they want to REALLY learn programming.\n\nProgramming is not useful unless you have a USE for it in the first place. Want to learn programming so you can solve a problem in your job? Go for it. Want to actually learn programming to get a job? All the best to you. Want to learn programming just so you know a skill? I highly doubt that you will be successful.\n\nTo learn something you need intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is when you NEED programming to solve a problem whether it be a financial problem or time problem. And extrinsic motivation is what you have schools and uni for (not bootcamps).\n\nI have been asking my brother (Professional structural engineer) for the last 3 years to code. 3 frickin years. \n\nAt first he will keep telling me I will start this weekend, then he will say I am busy, then he stopped replying.\n\nThen he came to me with a very complex linear algebra problem and told me to create a program for it, I told him learn python and numpy. I only know basic data analytics and web dev. He told me that he has a template in excel that already solves this problem why even bother learning python.\n\nBut I still I kept on insisting and he kept on deflecting on.\n\nThen I started to think that he probably didn't have much respect for me, or respect of my opinion. He is a shit brother. Programming changed my life and is an integral part of my life. He doesn't care for me or my opinion. \n\nLadies and gents this is what is called paranoia and bruised ego. My brother loves me dearly. He is not malicious, he is just lazy. To be honest he is not even lazy.... He is normal. Teaching your self something is incredibly difficult that is why we have schools and university. He has a stable life why bother his peace of mind by forcing himself to learn a skill that may not even come to his use.\n\nI realized that forcing or repeatedly telling people to code has less to do with them learning to code, it has more to do with boosting your ego as a programmer. Some people does not have the will power to teach themselves, some people do not have the time. Programming won't solve everything. \n\nIf a programmer can tell people to code I see frankly as a way to stroke your ego. Remember the thing \"Coal miners should learn to code\".\n\nWe are getting carried away with telling people to learn code. The resources are available and easily accessible. You don't have to push people to code. Give them a nudge if all you care and stay back that's all. Programming is typing and knowing the sytax the thing you do actually solving programmable problems. Stallman thinks coders as more like clerks and he illustrates a separation between problem solving and typing syntax.\n\nLearning to program requires patience and solving problem requires even greater patience. So, those who fails to learn programming in the first place and need incredible push to learn, can never succeed in solving programming problems.\n\nSo, don't push people. Don't stroke your ego. And definitely maintain a healthy relationship with your loved ones.\n\nConspiracy theory note: Those who force you to learn programming either don't know any better, seeks fame or has something to sale. Talk with a programmer with atleast 20 years of experience and you will see how apathetic they are about the hype of everyone should learn to code. Learning to code won't liberate you.\n\nThank you.\n\nAbout me: [Stuck in tutorial hell for 10 years. Make less than $100 doing freelancing. Accounting Bachelors & Masters.

Which is particularly important because many other AppXPackages (even perfectly innocuous ones like Calculator) auto-update via the Store, and can eventually completely fail to function or even launch if the Store has been removed.\n\nHonestly, AppXPackages are such finicky pieces of shit that I would never call any of these debloat scripts \u201cfool-proof\u201d or \u201cimpossible to break anything with.\u201d That goes doubly so for anything that fucks around with the Store. Especially since the way Microsoft handles them seem to change from feature update to feature update. Even what *might* be fine now could break something when the next feature pack comes out. Plus in my experience these issues can be sporadic. While everything might have been fine for you and your testers, it could definitely still break something for someone else. While I understand it\u2019s annoying to see all the stupid shit Microsoft adds to Windows out of the box, I\u2019ve found it simply isn\u2019t worth fucking around with them too much. There\u2019s certainly some stuff you can do to limit it, but most of the best options are GPOs, and a start menu XML to hide stuff. I know not everyone agrees with that, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d describe these sort of things as \u201ccan\u2019t possibly break anything.\u201d",

If the output lands in a file or somewhere else (e.g. an error capturing tool like sentry), it must not contain any color codes. As far as I can see, this project didn't even try. You can use `isatty` and look at various environment variables, but even that may fail from time to time due to various reasons.\n2. Removing the full paths is great for beginners with one or two files. But in a large project, it makes the error stack useless or at least very strenuous to read, because you now have to go on the hunt for every entry to find which project (and which filesystem location) the entry is from.\n3. On the opposite end, removing the string `line` makes it hard to understand for beginners what the numbers mean. This is doubly so because some logging is prone to include similar-looking numbers (HTTP codes, HTTP request/response size in Bytes).\n4. If it were to include full file paths, the stacktrace would become much longer due to the added newlines. This makes it harder to see the full stack trace (since it would now be on 3 instead of 2 80-row screens, or 2 instead of 1). Python's formatting is superior because you see more at once.",

Thing of them as x and y. Doing a simple arctan(y/x) gives you the angle of that point.

Epicycles are fun/look neat, but are horrible for explaining anything.\n\ntl;dr, almost everything important about fourier transforms comes from linear algebra. It is the exact same as the math behind [projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection). Functions are infinite dimensional vectors (one way to think about that is that the value at each point is an independent \"axis\" or \"degree of freedom\" that you can tweak without changing other values). The various fourier-related transforms are all examples of taking dot products to do a projection (onto functions like e^(iwt)). The inverse transform is just writing the function you started with in terms of its projections.\n\nThe reason why we pick exponentials in particular is that for exponentials, differentiation becomes multiplication. For systems that have certain symmetries (linearity, translation invariance), this lets us break apart complicated calculus problems into simpler algebra problems, solve them, and put the solutions back together.\n\nCircles and epicycles are a fun trick that are basically unrelated to how anyone thinks about or uses this stuff in the real world.",

The Fourier series is an estimation of the original function using a limited (versus infinite) nunber of sinusoids. Math-wise it uses an integral and complex valued functions to convert the function of time to a function of frequency. The discrete fourier transform decomposes a signal into its component frequencies, which is important in digital analysis of analog signals (like how songs are converted into bits). Essentially, the discrete fourier transform is used for discrete data (like what you would get from a sensor connected to a computer) versus the continuous fourier transform which requires continuous data.",

For the non-discrete version, you're doing linear algebra over spaces of functions, which mostly just means for the actual calculations, sums become infinite series/integrals (so calculus), and other than that the intuition is basically the same.\n\nIt's often taught under the umbrella of differential equations, \"engineering analysis\", or signal processing, though engineering programs like to skip the connections to linear algebra and just derive some of the forumulas as \"clever tricks\". Math departments might cover it as \"applied analysis\".\n\nThe important thing that engineering programs like to skim over is that differentiation and integration are both linear operators on function spaces. That is, they both act sort-of like infinite dimensional matrices. More applied linear algebra courses might only talk about matrices and not go into linear operators at all. You want one that talks about linear operators/maps.",

Instead of pulling in integers through prefetching and caches, the interpreter needs to fetch pointers, dereference, and fetch the integer, each time. This causes many more memory accesses, cache misses, and wrecks havoc on prefetching. Fetching from memory is  expensive on a 21st century CPU.\n\nFor python, this price in performance was deemed worth the uniformity in the language. Interpreted languages aren't chosen for their speed anyway. Nowadays, libraries like numpy provide that speed instead, modelling raw integer arrays.\n\nAn oddball here is OCaml, where integers are 63 bits, as the top bit must be 0 for integers. If the top bit is 1, the same value is actually a pointer to an object. The price for fixing the calculations to work with 63-bit values is lower than the extra memory accesses.

It's true that the way python as a language is implemented that everything is an object.\n\nAs far as the concepts of a class and objects in Object Oriented Design, you are correct that an object is an instance of a class (classes are often described as blueprints for objects). So:\n\n    class Animal:\n        def __init__(self, sound, num_legs=4):\n            self.sound = sound\n            self.num_legs=num_legs\n\n    >>> cow = Animal(\"moo\")\n    # cow is an object and an instance of the Animal class\n\n    >>> type(cow)\n    <class '__main__.Animal'>\n\n    >>> duck = Animal(\"quack\",num_legs=2)\n    # duck is also an object and instance of the Animal class\n\n\nAs others have noted, it just so happens that the way python is implemented behind the scenes that everything is an object, even the basic types. You can see this by the fact that even integers have a type and methods you can call on them:\n\n    >>> type(5)\n    <class 'int'> \n\n    >>> five = 5 # so we can access the int as a variable\n    >>> five.imag # because integers are implemented as objects, they have attributes associated with them\n    0 # the imaginary component of the number (if it were a complex number)",

A great example comes from the book [Art & Fear](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733):\n\n> The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the \"quantity\" group: fifty pound of pots rated an \"A\", forty pounds a \"B\", and so on. Those being graded on \"quality\", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an \"A\".\n\n> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the \"quantity\" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the \"quality\" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.",

This can be boring sometimes but you develop a sophisticated understanding of the tools that many complex problems like in this post become intuitive.\n  \nI also think it is important to jump into whatever topic interests you, even if it might be advanced. If you apply the basic learning above, but in the context of trying to execute a complicated algorithm like this program is doing, you learn to both things at the same time.\n  \nAs for others who also consider themselves beginners, don't worry about whether or not their is a right or wrong way to learn. You do whatever is natural to you and keeps you interested, but also recognize there is a requirement for discipline (which is true in any developing skills).",

IIRC if you overtrain some AI against itself, it might start developing weird traits that don't apply, and get good at fighting itself but not necessarily good against a human opponent who might play completely differently, might be trying strategies the AI never learned. Like if you have a game where there are three ways to win, and it starts finding out a way to win one of those ways, it might train itself to always do that and defend really well against it, and since it isn't trying to win the other ways, it might start to suck at defending against it, because it itself never got good at it and doesn't try that approach. Like if one way to win is usually the better way, it might learn that quickly and \"forget\" to even try another approach as it trains that strategy out.\n\nI don't think this is something where you can *blindly* just make an AI get better and better. You would have to have it fight against other AIs, to ensure its not reinforcing negative traits as well. Like if you had this four ply AI fight against it as well, you'd know it's at least going to keep defending against basic strategies even if it never uses them.",

As others have mentioned, to get a realistic font you need to take into consideration that the spacing between letters depends on what letter came before it. The clever thing was that when you ordered the font you would write a certain set of words that would capture all the common combinations and allow them to add hints to the font to make it look better and less regular.\n\nAs a side note writing something out by hand stimulates your brain neurons and you retain the infomation more so maybe the teacher has this in mind.\n\nAnyway, kudos for you for developing this to the point that you can demo it! That is impressive in itself.\n\nIf you can write a tool that takes the handwriting input sample, text to convert and returns the written text, that would be universally useful. Using machine learning to make an engine to do that would be a great project.",

Getting that amount of data would very likely be too much for an Arduino.\n\n\nNow, whether you could minimize that, by not getting it every frame, and instead only a few times a second, without your eyes noticing it, that'd be the real interesting part.\n\nIf the data is being captured by using a screen grab, another hard part to take into account is screen resolution. At 4k+, even shrunk down to a workable size, is still processing power used to shrink a 4k screen grab down to a manageable \"color checking\" size.\n\nIt's cool, but moving from stills into the realm of movies and video games seems very cumbersome or at least a large increase in code, and checking that things are working smoothly enough for the eye not to see a flicker, which could end up being more annoying than cool.",

You should see the GPU as a device on the network like a NAS or something. \n\nNormally, when you stream your video output, there is a dedicated chip to encode the signal to h264 (not 100% sure about the codec) and send the compressed signal to the CPU.\n\nThis library sounds promising:\nhttps://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss\n\u201cAn ultra fast cross-platform multiple screenshots\u201d\n\nI may try it sound in the weekend",

Anything other than the very basic operations of inputting a line of text or printing a line of text requires operating-specific modules from the Standard Library . So inputting single characters, output cursor control, or even clearing the screen, requires \"curses\" for Linux and Mac, and \"msvcrt\" for the Windows Terminal.

    "selftext": "\n\n\"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.\"\n\nThis is a long one, so I'm putting the TLDR up top:\n\n# TLDR\nA blackout has been proposed for June 12-14 to protest the API changes and extreme cost. \n\nThe r/Python community seems very vocal about joining the blackout and I would like the r/Python community's input on this. Would you like to participate? How would you like to participate? \n\nIf we do join the blackout, there are two different ways to participate which we need:\n- Setting the subreddit to private (no engagement at all--including no ability to explain why our sub is private)\n- Turning off submissions (the community and posts are still viewable, but no new comments or posts)\n\nPlease offer your feedback here, this isn't my decision alone to make.\n\n# Background to the issue:\nReddit has been making changes. \n\nAhead of their IPO, they're trying to get their ducks in a row, but in trying to maximize their value to potential shareholders, they're cutting off massive avenues of value to moderators and users. \n* Reddit, without warning, cut off [Pushshift's API access](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/134tjpe/reddit_data_api_update_changes_to_pushshift_access/) (The stated reason is no response--but given their pricing structure for 3rd party mobile apps, and the time frame Reddit gave third party apps, any response by pushshift would have almost certainly resulted in this same action)\n* Reddit is making a move to [remove API access to third party apps and developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/). It's no stretch that this move is motivated because after a number of years they're unable to compete in the mobile app space. So instead of 'git-ing gud' they're just shutting down competition. [Apollo App Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/), [Rif Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/)\n* They said RES will experience 'minimal' impact and old Reddit will be preserved. In the words of the Toolbox devs, \"[[they are not impacted.] Yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/comments/141locs/announcement_reddits_upcoming_api_changes_and/jn0klpy/?context=10000) (Toolbox is a great tool for moderation because moderating with Reddit's site tools alone is a pain), and similarly [RES developers are not overly trusting](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESAnnouncements/comments/141hyv3/announcement_res_reddits_upcoming_api_changes/). Similarly, the [API once was safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/142jwv3/oh_really_spez/jn5f0of/)\n* [Reddit has laid off 5% of their staff](https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-lay-off-about-5-workforce-wsj-2023-06-06/)\n\nThe above actions are presented with bias--because frankly I am biased and Reddit is presenting their reasoning with bias so please take both sides' explanations with a grain of salt. Or Crait's worth of salt. But I feel they are presented accurately enough for this post's purpose. \n\n# Why we care about these changes:\n## As a Moderator\nThere are a number of issues that a moderator has to deal with. \n\nFirst and foremost, I volunteer to do this. Moderation can be a drain on my energy, and is a time sink. Losing efficiencies reduce my ability to moderate, and Reddit Inc is laughably behind. \n\n* Reporting content as a moderator for admin review is an absolute pain, often a black box, there's at least three separate ways to report something instead of one consolidated form or three ways with parity across all three. The mechanisms have some overlap too. It's bad. \n* Often the admin response is subpar. As a mod I get that, my responses are subpar as well, and often times purposefully subpar because you need to make a decision on some content and there's just only so much to go off of. But it's for the extreme cases that the subpar response becomes a problem, like when there's a clear botnet falsifying engagement, and I've highlighted 10 accounts in it, and highlighted the way to flag them, and only two of those get tagged as \"actioned for ban evasion\" and the other 8 are free to keep on posting. Identifying a botnet should be easy on the Reddit side, it's exhausting on mine. One of the ways to help flag this is groups like Pushshift, and loosing that means I either knowingly allow manipulation or I give up more volunteer time hunting manipulation down. (By the way the specific one I am being vague about was brought to my attention thanks to a user's report. If they didn't flag it I probably would have missed that botnet, small though it was, so I really appreciate those comments and reports).\n* I cannot trust the admins. This isn't combative in nature, but it's because we have different goals. Often times they align, but sometimes our goals are at odds of each other. My goal is to try to make sure the communities I moderate are best able to thrive, and Reddit Inc's goals are to drive engagement and ad revenue. Usually, like when we get to do something fun like a great AMA, we get great community events and Reddit gets engagement and clicks. But long term, Reddit will always follow profit. \n\nSo these changes impact my workflow, and avenues to review and moderate content. And these are issues impacting our community. /r/Python is a great sub and great community. Compared to a lot of other subreddit we have relatively few issues. \n\nCommunities which are identity, political, or news in nature have to deal with so much more. There's a ton to manage, there's a ton of filtering for mental health and safety that is needed too. Reddit is getting there when it comes to a lot of features, but their implementation is slow. It's getting measurably faster as they restructure, but they're still catching up to third party apps. \n\n\n\n## As a reddit user/Python developer\nAPIs are important. They're a wonderful gateway to programming, they help webpages serve information in a more lightweight fashion when webscraping would be costly (if you just need an upvote count, it's smarter to just make a call for than, then making a call for every asset a webpage renders. This gets a user what they need and isn't a burden on the site they're engaging with). APIs as a result both act as a great learning mechanism and as a way to keep from burdening the site as a whole.\n\nNo third party apps as alternatives makes it easier for Reddit to harvest data without pushback. And it makes it harder for users to customize their experience. This can be exceptionally important when it comes to communities which cater to important segments of the population, but segments which are so small that a profit focused organization would otherwise ignore. \n\nOne of the more notable communities that these changes strongly impact is /r/blind, and there's an [explanation of these changes and their impact here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/). It's very probable that these issues will be quickly addressed now that they're in the public eye. But the underlying reality is that third party apps had been able to cater to users and communities and the Reddit app, with Reddit's stewardship, has failed to address accessibility at this level. \n\n\n\n# The Blackout\nOn June 12th a [blackout has been purposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/). \n\n[Many communities are praticipating](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/), and as this post points out we're curious if we should join. The blackout is either to cover a two day span, or last until demands are appropriately addressed. (this distinction is on a community basis, and will probably depend on how reddit responds)\n\nThere are different ways to perform it, either set the sub to private or lock the sub so no submissions can go through. Setting the sub to private prevents all engagement in the sub, but also means that presenting a message to users about what is going on isn't possible. \n\nI think it makes sense to keep the sub up and visible but to freeze it so no new posts or comments go through, but I'd like to hear your thoughts. \n\n# The Admins Response to the blackout\n[Here is their reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)\n\n\nA rough TLDR (I'm omitting the NSFW changes because... They're not clear to me. Maybe that's my shortfall but I think they're very vague about those)\n1) Reddit isn't changing their position at all. They're digging in their heels and 'clarifying' what they're doing. No decision is reversed. \n2) bots using api for mod tools will be safe--if they break \"[Reddit] will work with you to fix them. \" \n3) launching at future dates: mod features \n\n___\nOn 2)--they basically told Apollo app to, \"Figure it out themselves\"  https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmolrhn/?context=3\nso forgive me if I don't find goodwill in that message. \n\nOn 3) So many of those updates exist already in third party apps. So many of them are only getting attention this long into the Reddit app's lifespan because mods are making a stink about not moderating through the Reddit app. So especially for the rollout date of Sept. portions--I don't really believe it'll be executed well. And I don't want the mobile app on my phone. It's big, slow, and harvests a lot of data. \n\nAnd when that post went live Reddit was breaking again. \n\nhttps://www.redditstatus.com/\n\nNot really something that exudes confidence in their ability to make good product decisions.\n\nNow being fair here, there absolutely has been a [focus on improving modtools](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/107orxe/ringing_in_2023_with_a_2022_reflection_on_mod/) over this past year, but they're still wildly behind. It's.. uncomfortable to trust a site when they cut off the alternatives for profit. Once there's no competition there's no longer a reason to loose revenue on further developing these resources. \n\nWe were a part of the Reddit Talk platform development, and the admins we got to work with were lovely, and worked hard to greenlight the features moderators requested. A lot of those features were fleshing out the API so we could handle a Reddit Talk session in our workflows. \n\nBut after a while [they shutdown Reddit Talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTalk/comments/11m4ijn/sunsetting_reddit_talk/) and that makes it difficult to trust long term product commitments from Reddit. Even if we get great admins who listen to feedback rolling out a product--they're not ultimately the ones who make the calls for the future. \n\nThe admin response to the threat of a blackout reaffirms their changes and makes a lot of future promises for moderation tools. They sound good but at best those features should have been here ages ago, and their presentation betrays a lack of focus or care for moderation tools until recently. That recent change is affirming to see, but looking at Reddit's track record it might just be a passing phase until the public eye is off of the company. \n\n\n# What does this mean to /r/Python\nThat is mostly my question to you.\n\nThere are some defined things:\n\n- If we blackout, the sub turns off. No one can post or comment for a while, and we hope our added voice helps encourage Reddit to continue to allow third party apps.\n- If we don't join the blackout, we can still hope but there's less weight behind it. \n\nWe don't normally join in on Reddit's protests. So this would be a new thing for our community--is this cause worth the loss in a few days of posts?\n\nThere is a [post by another user asking this question](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1424s7m/going_dark_on_12th_june/) and at present it is the second most upvoted submission in the past year. So there has been a lot of great talk already, but I need to ask this question here as well to be sure I'm listening to the community as a whole. \n\n**Should /r/Python join the June 12th Blackout?** \n\nIf we do, should we completely go private, or should we prevent the commenting or posting in our community during that period so an explanation of what is going on is viewable?\n\nPlease give your feedback, I'm reading through both this and the original submission to keep an eye on things. Remember though, be respectful. We're a Python focused community, so in addition to the rules here in the sub, I hope you'll adhere to the [PSF Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/). Be respectful to one another. Disagree with opinions, but be respectful of people. \n\nAnd now for [something completely different](https://www.reddit.com/user/iamkindofcreative/m/a_green_space/)",

I don't know a reasonable number to charge for API access, but enough to pay infrastructure cost and whatever lost ad revenue makes sense to me.\n\nJust my opinion.",

        "body": "A lot of the subreddits that I visit are planning to do this. You get posts like this one which will have 1k upvotes and a few hundred comments. So it looks like the overwhelming majority of people support the idea, but I'm just not sure. \n\nI do think Reddit should be more reasonable in what they want to charge for API access, but by no means should it be free. Those apps are using Reddits content to make money, so Reddit should get something from that. They can't feed ads to those apps and it's unlikely that most of the app users are Reddit Premium members. This seems to be a huge sticking point for most people. They want Apollo to continue to exist because they like it and they are no ads, but someone has to pay for that.\n\nBack to the subs going dark, this sub has 1.1 million subscribed redditors (I'm not actually one of them, yet I read posts almost every day). That means that the vocal minority here of say 1000 people are going to decide to make the entire sub dark. As moderators it very much looks like you are forcing your opinion on all the other 99.999% of users. As, I said, I do support third-party apps to an extent (I originally paid for Apollo), but I spend most of my time on Reddit in a browser and the rest using the official Reddit app. This is the same for literally every other Reddit user I know personally. We are mostly in the IT field and are very tech savvy, we just don't feel the need to look for other options when the official option works for us.",

It absolutely will show up in their little KPI dashboards that presumably investors have some visibility into. \n\nBut the reality is that some number of Redditors still won't know/don't care and if it can be explained as \"Overbearing Admins block everyday Redditors from using the platform\", that's not a strong statement. A better statement would be \"Redditors en masse stop posting, despite all communities remaining open\" (a proper grassroots movement). Now, obviously this is hard to organize... Lots of other folks already mentioned \"what if I forget which days\" or \"what if people don't know what's happening\" or worse \"what if people don't care\"\n\nSo my question is how confident are we that we could see a meaningful drop in usage without enforcing it at a moderator level?",

        "body": "Here's my position on this as a 'no' voter.  I have a few kind of disorganized thoughts that I hope you spend some time to consider.\n\nI'm fully aware of the changes that are impacting 3rd party apps. I use these apps regularly, I've paid for them, and I recognize they will no longer work in the very near future. That said, at the end of the day, I strongly disagree with the 'censor the subreddit' tactic. If there's actual solidarity on reddit, then people will choose not to come here, they will choose not to post, and they will choose not to comment. If everyone is right that this calamitous for reddit, you don't need to close the subreddits. Market forces will close the subreddits (and reddit itself eventually). No one will be here because they all individually made the decision to delete whatever apps they use or delete their accounts. If moderators are frustrated with the potential loss of mod tools, then they should organize, and as one body say \"Hey, I'm done moderating. reddit can find itself new moderators who want to do the job,\" and release the sub to someone else. And if reddit can't find replacements, well, that's a problem for reddit because the market has spoken and no one wants to run their forums. \n\nI say all of the above having been on (and having left) Digg, Xanga, LiveJournal, MySpace, Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, and probably more that I can't think of right now.  I didn't leave any of those because a small group of people turned off my access to the common parts of the site.  I left them because they all made decisions that I disliked, and like many people, I stopped using the site.  That's my position on reddit right now.  Let the users vote with their own wallets, their own eyes and their own feet.  If these changes are that problematic, then people will leave without moderators taking it upon themselves to silence entire swaths of the user base.  Doing that feels like a small group of power-users saying \"If we don't get our way, nobody can play on reddit.\"  That's a problem, and I profoundly disagree with that approach.\n\nThis subreddit has over a million users. As of this moment, about 350 people have left comments about this.  That means a decision impacting all million plus users of this sub is potentially directed by a core of around 0.03% of r/python's users.   I don't think you should censor the other 99.97% of users on their behalf.\n\nI also don't believe this protest will be effective aside from maybe fracturing some reddit communities.  Maybe that's your goal in protesting, but that feels like poor stewardship on the part of a subreddit leadership that represents one of the largest programming subreddits on here.\n\nThe reason I say that has to do with the way reddit runs generally.  If r/python goes dark, most people won't know it.  If you go to r/all on the 12th, it will still be full of new posts from a wide variety of subreddits.  They may not be from the 'default' or 'typical' subs, but reddit isn't going to be a wasteland.  The 'going dark' movement is going to cause a bunch of unknown subs to balloon in popularity.  \n\nIf you generally subscribe to a lot of subreddits, your own homepage is going to do the same.  All of those smaller subreddits will have an influx of users, and it will just push out the subs that go dark.\n\nI think the only particular impact would be for users looking specifically for r/python.  r/python isn't the only python subreddit.  If those users see this one is dark, they'll just go to the next one that's open.  The biggest effect of that is some people might have a slightly more annoying time trying to solve a coding problem, and they will be left with a bad taste in their mouth about r/python (or maybe Python more generally if they are looking for new coder support).  I've been here for a long time, and I would hate to see this wonderful sub get pulled into partisanship and bickering.\n\nAll of that said, I hope you make the decision to keep r/python open to the public.  \n\nThank you for your time.",

Which the 3rd party tools provide.\n\n\\- The blind and people with other disability use 3rd party to make reddit usable\n\n\\- The fees are to crush 3rd party, which it appears is working as all apps are bailing and will be dead come end of month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe better solution might have been that you can use 3rd party if you subscribe to gold. This would drive monetization and in a way that would probably be fine with the user base?\n\nThen you get to the CEO of reddit saying Appollo dev tried blackmail not knowing the convo had been recorded. Once confronted he then doubled down anyway. The whole AMA farce showed contempt for the user base imho\n\nI am sure this is all driven by rising interest rates and the VC firehose easing as AI is the new VC gold rush. But changes have to normally be done well not to cause a backlash like this. Instead of getting income from API they will get nothing and an annoyed user base and modding community so worst possible case really.",

Since it costs money for Reddit to host and serve up the content, then, depending on exactly how the numbers work out, Reddit may make more money during the blackout (less expenditures vs less income).\n\nIf a forum goes private, then Reddit knows that the mods are upset, but has no insight into how many of the users are upset.  If the blackout goes on very long, then new subreddits will be made by those that don't care and people will just migrate to those. \n\nOnly deleting an account shows commitment and is not controlled by mods.

(Also, Pygame is more \u201cdo it yourself\u201d than most engines, which works better with the way I think.) Using engines is probably easier to get started on since they have all those built in systems for all sorts of types of games. For me personally, it mostly comes down to the development speed. I compete in lots of 48 hour game jams, so I can really see how much faster it is.\n\nFor me, the biggest annoyance is that I can\u2019t warp images aside from resizing and rotating. (the type of warping you\u2019d see on textures in 3D games; not that I\u2019d use it for that) Pygame 2 might be getting something that does that though. I\u2019ve written some functions that warp images, but working on a pixel level in Python is slow. I\u2019ve been learning C though, so I might just write my own system for that in C for use with Python.\n\nIAP as in an actual app for a mobile device? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m guessing that would require specific APIs. In terms of PC games, you can definitely do it. As for ads, I don\u2019t think so. Those are usually built into engines so advertisers can know their ad was visible. Some alternatives would be using popup ads by opening a web browser or just doing sponsorship type agreements.",

So it looks like you MUST stand outside of the frame at the start. It captures the background then and goes from there. Now, I bet there is a way to use openCV to detect the person (and even do face detection so it works with certain people only) to create a mask around the person as well.  \nNow that I'm thinking about this, you could probably achieve the exact same effect without a screen  and just a simple hand gesture.

Python 4.0 will most likely be very different from Python 3.x, with a lot of new features and changes in the internal VM. In this case though, its interesting to see how they plan to make the transition smooth instead of another Python 2 vs 3 chaos. \n\nWhatever will happen, lets hope that at the very least, Python will stick with the the Zen(PEP 20) that 'Simple is better than Complex' and 'There should be one, and preferably only one obvious way to do it'. These are the characteristics of Python that makes it easier for beginners/data scientists, and part of the reason why it beats Perl and Ruby in terms of popularity.",

The Python core devs:\n\n* Ported heaps of features from Python 3 to Python 2.6 and 2.7 to ease the transition; essentially every new feature added to Python after 2.5 was intended to allow folks to take their time to migrate to Python 3.\n\n* Gave Python 2.7 an extra long support period to give people sufficient time to upgrade (2.7 had a full decade of support, instead of the usual 4 or 6 years).\n\n* Re-introduced old Python 2 syntax like u'' when it became obvious that was needed for people writing dual 2+3 code.\n\n* Created and managed the [2to3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html) translator.\n\nThe bottom line here is that the core devs started planning the move to [Python 3000](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3000/) (as it was originally known) somewhere around 2005 or 2006, they debated and discussed every step along the way, wrote PEPs, backported features to keep 2.x in step with 3.x where possible, and kept that going for over a decade before dropping support for 2.7. And during this period, Python's user base has grown and grown and grown.\n\n\n> I'm in the process of a breaking release right now and we're putting an ungodly amount of time into debating every breaking change and determining migration steps to ease migrations for users.\n\nCome back when you've spent even a hundredth of the time and effort that the Python devs did.\n\n> Python basically released a whole new language\n\nThat's pure unadultered bullshit.\n\nHaving actually written a lot of dual 2 + 3 code, I can tell you that syntactically Python 2 and 3 are about 98% identical, the stdlib is about 80% the same, and there are only a handful of places where they differ sufficiently that it is painful or impossible to write 2+3 code in a single file.\n\n> with python 3 and many companies/libraries just flat out refused to migrate for a long time.\n\nAnd they were right to.\n\nAt the time, the core devs expected that people would not migrate immediately and that this would be a long-term transition.\n\n(Although even Guido initially imagined that \"long term\" would mean something like five or seven years, not twelve. In that regard, they were a victim of their own helpfulness: the more features they ported to 2.x, the less incentive people had to migrate to 3.x.)",

        "body": "Sure thing. For readability, the following examples use Python-like formatting, but aren't real Python, just pseudocode.\n\nPractically every programming language has a loop construct.\n\n    for i = 1 to 3:\n        print(i)                               # prints 1, 2, 3\n\nIt's a simple iteration, and it is frequently used to loop through list-like structures, like using this code to print each element from the list:\n\n    a = [4, 5, 6]\n    for i = 1 to len(a):\n        print(a[i])                            # prints 4, 5, 6\n\nNotice that in this code, the only purpose of the loop value, `i`, is to count through the items of the list. So, many languages give us some syntax to avoid the loop value entirely, and instead loop directly over the items of the list:\n\n    a = [1, 2, 3]\n    for value in a:\n        print(value)                           # prints 1, 2, 3\n\nNow, another common use of loops is to take in one list and produce another list, like this:\n\n    a = [1, 2, 3]\n    b = []\n    for value in a:\n        b.append(value)                        # b = [1, 2, 3]\n\nOr, more interestingly, to take a first list, manipulate each of the values, and make a new list out of the manipulated values:\n\n    a = [1, 2, 3]\n    b = []\n    for value in a:\n        b.append(value + 2)                    # b = [3, 4, 5]\n\nIn fact, this task - taking in one list and producing another list based on it - is so common that Python gives us an even simpler way of expressing that task as one statement:\n\n    a = [1, 2, 3]\n    b = list(value + 2 for value in a)         # b = [3, 4, 5]\n\nThat's the basic function of list comprehension: take in one list (a), do something to each member, and assemble the resulting values into another list (b). This syntax also allows us to ditch the syntax of creating an empty list (`b = []`), and of sticking the values into it (`b.append(...)`) - it just produces a new list and assigns it to b.\n\nNote that the terms \"a,\" \"b,\" and \"value\" aren't fixed keywords - we can use any labels we want:\n\n    x = [1, 2, 3]\n    y = list(z + 2 for z in x)                 # y = [3, 4, 5]\n\nWe're also not limited to lists of integers - the list can contain anything, like strings:\n\n    x = ['red', 'gray', 'blue']\n    y = list(s for s in x)        # y = ['red', 'gray', 'blue']\n\nOr instances of a class, for which we can do stuff with the properties of each instance:\n\n    class Car:\n        def __init__(self, color):\n            self.color = color\n\n    x = [Car('red'), Car('gray'), Car('blue')]\n    y = list(c.color for c in x)  # y = ['red', 'gray', 'blue']\n\nThis syntax is so useful that we can use it for all kinds of things, like calling a function on each of the values in the list, and assembling a list of the output of the function for each input:\n\n    def add_two(value):\n        return value + 2\n\n    x = [1, 2, 3]\n    y = list(add_two(z) for z in x)            # y = [3, 4, 5]\n\nAnd sometimes we don't want every member in the list - we want to test each value in the input list, and generate a new list of only the items that satisfy the test:\n\n    x = [1, 2, 3]\n    y = list(z for z in x if z > 1)            # y = [2, 3]\n\nOr we can do both - perform a test on the values of the list to choose some of them, manipulate them, and generate a list of the manipulated values:\n\n    x = [1, 2, 3]\n    y = list(add_two(z) for z in x if z > 1)\n               # y = [add_two(2), add_two(3)] = [4, 5]\n\nThe elegant part of this syntax is that by discarding the mechanical parts, what's left is quite easy to understand, even if you're not familiar with Python. And you can do a lot with just a little bit of code.\n\nHopefully, that's enough to give you a taste of what list comprehension can do. There are plenty of guides with even more powerful examples.",

There is no planned migration from Perl to Perl 6, and to make that clear and avoid further confusion, the language has been renamed to Raku.\n\nI understand why this looks like a *fail* to some, but to put a positive spin on it... I get to keep my Perl, plus get a fun new language to play with... and Raku is a very fun language to use. Yes the user-base is small, but that applies to Crystal, Nim, and Racket as well.

So I'll take it with a grain of salt. I'd like to see if Python 3.8 still has this problem.\n\nFor non-empty collections it makes total sense. There's argument parsing and/or translation from one collection to another that has to happen.\n\nBut as I said above, for empty collections, it would be trivial to optimize the slow case into the fast case. If it hasn't already been implemented, then it should be. There's no reason that `[]` and `list()` should generate different bytecode.\n\n(In fact, it seems possible to optimize many of the non-empty use cases too.)",

Also, so what if he launched a car for the sake of it, it's his money to spend, he can wipe his ass with it for all I care.\n\nAs for laying off a shitload of employees, well every business in history did it at some point when they faced economical problems, isn't that what they do then? Even if they didn't, why would you keep employees around if they don't serve any purpose? As ornaments or something?\n\nI have no idea how any of this serves as an example of his self-obsession, the connection simply isn't there.

It also skims through most advanced topics.\n\nRight after completing it I read Automate the Boring Stuff which I consider a must for any beginner python beginner.\n\nAfter that I went on to completing some Katas on codewars.com and started working on my own projects which involved scraping data and using it to perform calculations. Building projects taught me way more than any course ever did. I had to work with pandas, numpy, itertools and many other libraries which I didn't even know existed at that point.\n\nWhen I felt stuck at my project I started reading Dan Bader's Python Tricks book. It made me understand that courses are only the first step to learning and that you havw to read books to actually understand a language in depth.\n\nI then continued with the Data Science course on Udemy and kept working on my project. I implemented 2 machine learning models which were very efficent in predicting the data I had.\n\nLast step was sending my CV on very remote corner of the industry and failing 10 straight interviews (and losing one due to the pandemic).\n\nI as lucky since I landed a job on a company which didn't require experience as much as it valued passion for learning and programming (they still thoroughly checked my projects though)\n\n\nMost important thing is having the will to quit TV shows, games, movies and whatnot.\n\nGoodluck to everyone!",

If your sequence-to-sequence translation model fails to perform well, how will you optimize it?  Which metric should you use to evaluate it and why?  You have limited time series data, what choices will you make to train a Gaussian process, and why?

It costs way too much that I could afford hosting it for longer. I do asked for donations but it just was way too less (a few people did and I'm sorry for them this has to end so quickly, )\nGrowing the bot bigger to reach even more people and hoping for more donations wouldn't be feasible with the instagram api since the bot would get banned even faster.",

Almost all models in science and engineering that describe our world are given in the form of partial differential equations. In the case of this black hole, you have Einstein's field equations (until they break down at the singularity but I won't get into that). In quantum physics you have the Schrodinger equation, or more complex methods, Maxwell's equations describing electromagnetism, various types of diffusion equations describing heat or mass transfer or fluid dynamics, which are highly relevant in both engineering and theoretical physics. \n\nThese are all partial differential equations, and most phenomena can be described by them. However in almost any real world interesting case, they are too complex to solve analytically. However, even though these equations are described on a continuous domain, like 3 dimensional space, or 4 dimensional spacetime, you can discretize that space into a grid, and demand that the equations are all satisfied on each grid element. \n\nSo instead of a derivative of a continuous function on continuous space, that derivative is replaced by a difference quotient, where its basically the change in your function of interest divided by your grid size spacing, or divided by your time step since you need to discretize time as well. Normally the derivative is defined as the limit as these spacings go to zero, but if you keep it discrete, depending on specifics of your method, you usually end up with a huge number of simultaneous algebraic equations (usually linear), since you haven't introduced derivatives any where. \n\nSo now, instead of a relatively small number of equations that exactly describe your system, but that are extremely hard or impossible to solve exactly, you get an enormous number of equations that approximately describe your system that are much easier to solve. The issue comes in because while systems of linear equations are relatively easy to solve from an algorithmic standpoint, you sometimes end up with millions of them that need to be solved, which can require huge amounts of computing resources. \n\nIn the end though, you get a huge amount of discrete data points that describe your system over space and how it evolves over time, and can then plot them.",

        "body": "The simple answer is that light is affected by gravity. Just like a ball will arc when you throw it, light will arc in the presence of gravity. Now, light is moving SO INSANELY FAST and photons are so incredibly light that normally this is undetectable. Around a black hole though, the gravity is so high that we can see the light bending around the event horizon. \n\nThe ring of glowing material you see is called the accretion disk. Kind of like Saturn\u2019s rings, this is material that is trapped in orbit around the black hole and it forms a disk because of the residual \u201cspinning\u201d left over by the cloud it formed from. While Saturn\u2019s disk is made of ice and rock, the accretion disks of black holes are usually made of burning hydrogen/helium and the leftovers from supernovas, and so it\u2019s glowing hot. \n\nWhere these two ideas interact is that when light leaves the top of the accretion disk on the far side of the black hole, it will actually get bent around and so you see it from the front. It\u2019s hard to describe without pictures, but here\u2019s the best one I could find: https://images.app.goo.gl/TXP3Fy7La13QQJvcA . The light above and below the black hole is actually the image of the back side of the accretion disk being bent around and toward you. \n\nMore reading: https://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/",

Here's a clip that features the black hole: \nhttps://youtu.be/1t73rxE5T_I\n\nEdit: In other words, yes, there IS an actual ring around the hole, and if it weren't for the visual distortions its shape would look just like Saturn's rings! However, not all black holes have accretion disks; the disks are made of very hot matter spinning around just outside the black hole's event horizon. (The event horizon is kind of like the boundary of the BH, and once you go past it you can never get back out again.) Here's a clip of a black hole without one: https://youtu.be/S6qw5_YA8iE",
